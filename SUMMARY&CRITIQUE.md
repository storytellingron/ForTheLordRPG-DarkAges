Here’s a summary of **For The Lord RPG: The Dark Ages** (the version at your link) — covering its setting, aims, core mechanics, and themes.

---

## 🎯 Core Idea & Themes

* The game is explicitly a *Christian RPG*. Its aim is to offer an alternative to “pagan” or secular fantasy RPGs by framing play around Christian mission, evangelism, conversion, church-planting, and moral struggle. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Players are not gods, prophets, or supernatural heroes — but rather ordinary (or somewhat ordinary) Christians (missionaries, “saints”, clergy, etc.) navigating a dangerous, often morally challenging world. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* The emphasis is on faith, fellowship, evangelism, church planting, redemption of pagans, spiritual warfare, and living out Christian values in “the Dark Ages”: conversion and ministry are central. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* It approaches the medieval-Dark Ages setting with a mix of historical flavor + folklore + spiritual conflict: there is “some fantasy” (dark magic, curses, paganism, demonic or spiritual evil) — but the Christian worldview dominates. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

---

## 🌍 Setting & Roleplaying Premise

* The timeframe and milieu is loosely early-medieval Europe: echoing the post-Roman / early “Dark Ages” period when Rome has fallen, paganism and emerging barbarian kingdoms (with some Christian influence) populate the land. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* The world is dangerous and chaotic: fractured political entities (duchies, kingdoms), remnants of Roman/Byzantine culture, barbarian invasions, pagan tribes, isolated communities, distrust, spiritual darkness. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* There are opportunities: players as missionaries might convert pagans, establish churches, spread Christian teaching — but they also face danger from pagan beliefs, hostility, demonic influences, and moral/spiritual conflict. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* The game supports “heroes of faith” but in a realistic human sense: bravery, compassion, preaching, witnessing, community building — not magic superpowers or divine intervention. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

---

## ⚙️ Game System & Mechanics

* The main resolution mechanic uses a **d20 + trait/skill + bonus dice-pool** system. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* The bonus dice-pool is calculated via “Die Ranks (DR)” — where skills, blessings, gear, and other factors grant DR. DRs aggregate: every 5 DR becomes a d12, with leftover DR giving smaller dice (d4/d6/d8/d10 depending on remainder). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* On a roll, you roll the d20 + trait/skill bonuses + one die from your dice-pool, keeping the highest result. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Default “Difficulty” for tasks is 12 (unless modified by situational factors). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* For complex or high-stakes tasks, a more granular result is possible: the “Die-Rank Result” (DRR) system measures how much the roll succeeded (or failed) beyond just pass/fail, allowing scaled outcomes (e.g. partial success, consequences, more narratively rich results). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Combat, maneuvers, interaction, social or spiritual tasks (preaching / conversion / healing / blessings) all resolved with the same core mechanic. Gear, armor, weapons, blessings or “faith-based” bonuses are represented within the DR/bonus-dice system. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Spiritual elements: there are “Blessings” and “Faith Points” for clergy/missionary-type characters, used when preaching, healing, evangelizing or spiritual tasks. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Progression: Through experience, gear, possibly church-establishment or successful conversions/missionary work. Over time, as characters (and possibly their church) grow, they gain access to improved skills / gear / influence, and face more challenging missions. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

## 📖 What Player-Characters & Roles Look Like

* Players take on the roles of missionaries, evangelists, clergy, “saints”, maybe pious travelers or believers who engage with pagans, travel through dangerous lands, preach, evangelize, convert, protect newly converted converts, build churches or communities. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* There is room for “traditional fantasy-type” roles: fighting or defending — but always within the worldview of Christian mission, spiritual struggle vs. evil paganism. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* NPCs might include pagans (hostile or potentially convertible), local pagan leaders, villagers in need of help, demonic or magically corrupted enemies, other medieval-era cultural groups (Romans, Lombards, pagan tribes, remnants of Byzantines), who may react differently depending on approach (force vs. faith). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* The moral/spiritual dimension is central: rather than mere adventuring for treasure or glory, the “goal” is often evangelism, saving souls, establishing churches, maybe redemption or spiritual salvation for individuals and communities — not just loot. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

---

## ✅ What the Game’s For & Its Intended Audience / Purpose

* The creator’s stated goal: provide a “Christian alternative” to mainstream fantasy/RPGs (which often embrace paganism, magic, morally ambiguous tropes). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Encourage Christian fellowship, evangelism, moral storytelling, and involvement of Christians across denominational lines (the game states it’s open to “Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox”) — focusing on faith-driven storytelling over doctrinal debates. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Offer a game that is “fun, heroic and silly” at times — not strictly a theological treatise, but a game that balances faith themes with classic RPG adventure, with some historical/flavor realism mixed with folkloric/fantasy elements (pagan magic, curses, spiritual evil). ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* Suitable for groups wanting “family-friendly or traditional family values,” within the designer’s interpretation: mission, evangelism, spiritual warfare, but also community, fellowship, redemption. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

---

## ⚠️ What Kind of Game / Play It’s *Not*

* It is **not** a high-fantasy game in the standard “wizard, sorcerer, dragon, magic-school” sense. While there is “some fantasy,” magical/supernatural powers are generally tied to “dark forces” (paganism, demonic power, curses) or to “blessings/faith” — but the emphasis is on spiritual conflict and evangelism, not on magical power-gaming. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* It is not a neutral or secular RPG — the faith and worldview are explicit, and the game design, tone, and goals are aligned with a conservative Christian perspective. ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* It is not meant to promote controversial or modern social ideologies (by author’s design). The creator explicitly states that the material “will not promote Woke, BLM or LGBTQ+ ideologies,” and portrays “witchcraft & sorcery correctly as evil.” ([Storytelling Ron][1])
* It is not a theological discourse or doctrinal teaching tool. The author cautions that it is not a “theological treatise,” but rather a **game** — meaning it uses a simplified or even “loose” approach to theology/history, favoring gameplay, narrative, mission-based objectives rather than theological rigor. ([Storytelling Ron][1])

## 📝 Overall Impression — What It Brings

* The design is bold in that it attempts to create a faith-centered RPG, merging role-playing and spiritual themes in a historical-fantasy “Dark Ages” setting. It gives a way for Christian players to enjoy RPGs while reflecting their beliefs.
* The mechanics are relatively straightforward (d20 + bonuses + dice pools) but flexible enough to support a range of activities: combat, evangelism, social interaction, preaching/conversion, exploration, survival, even “ministry work.”
* The mixture of medieval-era historical flavor + folklore + spiritual warfare offers a distinct mood: dangerous, morally charged, but also hopeful (mission, conversion, redemption).
* The game opens the possibility for cooperative storytelling that’s spiritually directed (church planting, building Christian communities, saving souls) rather than power-gaming or loot-driven adventuring.

If you like — I can also **critique** it: point out **strengths** and **potential problems or design tensions** (especially from a broader RPG design / playability / inclusivity point of view).

Here’s a **respectful but honest critique** of *For The Lord RPG: The Dark Ages*, from both a **game-design perspective** and a **table-culture perspective**.
(My goal: help you strengthen the game, not attack its worldview.)

---

# ⭐ What the Game Does Well

## **1. Strong identity & thematic clarity**

The game knows exactly what it wants to be: a Christian faith-centered RPG with evangelism and moral struggle as core gameplay.
That clarity is a **huge strength**, because:

* Players know the intended tone immediately.
* Worldbuilding + mechanics + setting all serve the game’s purpose.
* It’s distinct in a crowded RPG field.

Having a unique identity is *gold* in TTRPG design.

---

## **2. A coherent worldview**

The game does not pretend to be neutral — it clearly communicates its worldview and goals. This creates a consistent thematic experience.
If you’re targeting Christian groups seeking a faith-aligned RPG, this is a major selling point.

---

## **3. A unified resolution system**

The DR / dice-pool + d20 combo, while somewhat mathy, is consistent across actions.
That’s good design:

* Social, spiritual, and combat actions use the same structure.
* Scaling difficulty through DRR gives you room for gradated outcomes.
* The system has potential for interesting narrative complexity.

---

## **4. The “mission-driven” adventure model**

Having gameplay revolve around evangelism, preaching, diplomacy, village-building, etc., is genuinely *fresh*.
It gives players a reason to:

* travel
* protect vulnerable people
* negotiate with pagans or hostile leaders
* confront spiritual/moral threats

It’s distinctive, and it avoids the “loot treadmill” of D&D-style games.

---

# 🔍 Where the Game May Struggle

## **1. Tone & framing may limit your audience more than necessary**

The game’s opening statements — especially the lines about not promoting Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+ issues, “woke ideologies,” etc. — may instantly alienate players who *otherwise would be fine with a Christian RPG*.

From a game-design/business standpoint:

* You are narrowing your audience *much more* than simply “Christians only.”
* It signals culture-war alignment rather than just faith alignment.
* It risks framing the game as reactionary instead of visionary.

If your goal is outreach or inclusivity for Christians of all backgrounds, this may hurt you more than help.

**Suggestion:**
Shift from *“we reject XYZ ideology”* to *“here’s what our game focuses on and celebrates.”*
Positive framing is more inviting.

---

## **2. Evangelism as a primary gameplay loop can create table-flow issues**

As a role-playing mechanic, evangelism/preaching is tricky:

* Repeated “conversion scenes” can become mechanically repetitive.
* Players may feel forced into one dominant mode of play.
* Some players love diplomacy; others prefer action or exploration.

If *all* story roads lead to evangelism, campaign variety may suffer.

**Suggestion:**
Develop more adventure types:

* rescuing persecuted believers
* political intrigue in a Christian/pagan court
* spiritual mysteries
* moral dilemmas
* journeys into plague-stricken villages
* relic-recovery quests
* disputes within early Christian communities

Tie them into faith themes without making “convert pagan → build church → repeat” the only path.

---

## **3. The worldbuilding sometimes conflates history, theology, and fantasy in ways that may confuse players**

The setting is “Dark Ages Europe, but with some fantasy,” but:

* Paganism is portrayed mostly as monolithic and evil.
* Christian groups are portrayed as unified and aligned.
* The historical complexities (Arian Christians, Byzantines, tribal politics, syncretism, etc.) are largely absent.

This can create:

* historically thin background
* simplified moral dynamics
* limited NPC depth (“pagan = needs conversion / possibly dangerous”)

Even for a faith-centered game, nuance can create better story tension.

**Suggestion:**
Add more kinds of pagans, more varied motives, more shades of human behavior on *all* sides.

---

## **4. The dice-rank system is clever but numerically heavy**

The DR → d12 + remainder → d4/d6/d8/d10 system is interesting, but:

* It may intimidate casual players.
* It can slow down play when tallying DRs.
* The “keep highest die” mechanic may make bonuses feel swingy instead of steady.

It’s not broken — but it’s crunchy.
If your target audience includes non-gamers (church groups, etc.), simplification might help.

**Suggestion:**
Offer an optional “lite mode” with:

* flat bonuses
* fixed die sizes
* fewer stacking components

This would make demos and one-shots easier.

---

## **5. The game risks feeling didactic if GMs aren’t careful**

Because the theme is moral and religious, inexperienced GMs may accidentally drift into:

* railroading (“you must convert these NPCs”)
* moral lectures
* punishing players for nuanced or gray choices

You do a good job reminding players “this is just a game, not theology,” but more GM guidance could help:

**Suggestion:**
Add a chapter on:

* how to run faith-centered games without moralizing
* how to portray pagans respectfully while maintaining the spiritual conflict
* how to let player characters fail without spiritual shame

This will dramatically improve campaign quality.

# 🎯 Big Picture: The RPG Has Huge Potential, but its Reach Will Depend on Framing

The game is **unique**, **bold**, and **purpose-driven**.
Its biggest strengths (strong identity, evangelism themes, spiritual tension) are also its biggest risks (narrow audience, repetitive loop, tone barriers).

If your goal is:

### 🔵 A niche Christian game for a specific community → You’ve already succeeded.

### 🔵 A broader-appeal faith-inspired RPG → A bit of reframing + more nuance will help immensely.

---

# If you want, I can also:

✅ Identify **specific mechanical issues** (math, balance, dice distribution)
✅ Suggest **worldbuilding expansions**
✅ Propose **new character classes, blessings, miracles, or adversaries**
✅ Help you refine the **preamble** to widen appeal
✅ Write a **GM chapter** on handling sensitive themes

Just tell me which direction you’d like to go!
