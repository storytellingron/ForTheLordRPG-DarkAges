Here yee will find the evil powers that wreak havoc among our attempts to spread the Gospel, establish churches and bring peace to the land.


NOTE: A separate supplement has listings of swarms, critters, creatures, beasts, villagers, cultists, witches & more!

Luke 22:35 Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”
“Nothing,” they answered.
36 “Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. 37 For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors. For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”
38 So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.

VITALITY VS VIGOR	
For the confusion and the fun of it, both are used and both mean the same thing, representing hit point, stamina, exhaustion, pain, pangs, stress, endurance and how much one can take before collapsing in pain and/or exhaustion. Vigor is generally used for non-Christians, villainous characters and the beasts.

The Basic Chart	
The following page with the chart depicts the simplicity of creating adversaries. The listings are primarily focused on combat or violent threats. Other threats or roleplaying confrontations can be determined using the previous pagan info pages.
These pages are to give one villains and beasts for adventure, combat and fun. We can not deny the desire to be adventurous in our stories and to sometimes confront evil with the edge of a sword.
There is a separate supplement of creatures and villains, they are guides and not absolute. Each is a starting point to craft one’s own version or for simplicity sake to use as is.
The main thing to understand as a GM, is to make the enemies and foes somewhat comparable to the missionaries’ ability to defeat them. If the evil should be very powerful, which it can be, give fair warning, via the story, to missionaries before they try to confront or stop such enemies.
The chart shows the relative strengths of villains that one can use to quickly drum up any challenging foe.
Creature listings	
The goal is to have simple clear listings for creatures with their average trait, defense and armor save. There are listings for potential weapons and attacks. Only one should be used per turn unless there is a note or if the GM feels they can do more. Many will have one attack that could lead into another, like a charge and if successful it leads into a stomping or bite.
For beasts, their spirit trait is just a determination of their bravado, using each number as a die rank for any Denouement roll. Many creatures will not have all traits listed, that means those type of rolls will not come in to play. A Spirit of 1 or less means a d4 Denouement roll or susceptibility to evil spirits or possessions.

•	Speed
A common beast in the forest. It will flee if given the opportunity. It will charge if cornered, then flee. Any hunted can bring a fair bit of trade +d4. They can become susceptible to feral and evil curses that make them more dangerous.
Mark 5:2 As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs. 3 This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains. 4 Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.

	CreatureAbilities	
	Charge, Knockdown, Trample, Stomp	
Most brutal beasts on four legs rely on their attacks overpowering their prey. Any brutal beast will generally behave this way.
•	Must have room to charge!
•	Fumbles on Nat1 and 2.
•	Can be shot at and attacked by anyone adjacent path of charge. If takes more damage than their Pro, they lose their charge & attack.
•	Attack bonus is +1DR to hit & +1DR to damage (increases damage die)
•	To hit result must be resisted with Pro or one is knocked down. One may add their armor save to this resist!
•	Charger, successful, gets a free trample, stomp immediately if they have it.
Inherent Traits	
Armor, Tough. Thick hide, scales, toughness, giantism. This adds a +1DR to their armor saves. Or it can affect their defense, like Tiny +2 to Defense.
Brute or Brutal +d#*. Beyond human strength, they will have a secondary die to damage. This means the die are added together as opposed to the normal ‘keep highest’. For example it will look like d12+d4*.
Camouflage. Many creatures in their environment will have natural stealth +DR.
Foul. Some creatures are so foul they may induce a poisonous affliction upon those near it. One may resist it with their Prowess or Spirit depending on the strength noted as the test number.
Giant. This creature is of unusual size and thusly awarded additional +1DR or more in certain traits like strength, damage, armor saves and/or fear. The Brute ability may apply.
Keen senses. Hearing. Sight. Smell. Any combination of these, when used, gives additional die ranks to sensing others.
Resistance or Resist. Some creatures have natural resistance to certain things, magic, rot, certain kinds of damage, some may be resistant to certain elements. This will be noted in each creature, like cold resistance. This is usually a die rank to resist or added to Armor Save.
Speed. These creatures are very fast and can catch humans easily. Consider their move to be two moves.
Weakness. Creatures may have a fear or weakness to something. A die rank penalty or doubling of damage dice may occur. The fear of fire is common to most creatures.
Unique abilities	
Bark or Roar. A loud cantankerous noise that alerts allies and can stun a target. This is against anyone in short range. Targets must resist using their Prowess or Spirit or be at -1DR or DRR fail for the encounter. Prowess of the creature +10 denotes the roar test number.
Feral or Demonic. These creatures are cursed or drugged by shamans and have become bloodthirsty beasts. They are made to attack one’s foes or released or set free in an area to wreak terror. They have the same stats as their natural selves but add an unholy +d4* to any aspect that the shaman or demonic influence has affected. They may have the Brute ability!
Lair. Many creatures in their environment will have gained natural die rank upgrades to their skills, like stealth and Prowess tests. Protecting their territory could enhance their innate skills.
Pack Attack. This creature tends to fight alongside others of its kind. They understand the advantage to attacking in numbers and gain 1DR to their to hit roll if an ally is adjacent.
Poison#. If this number of damage occurs after an armor save, then there is an additional poison attack or resist and effect.
Possessed Resistance: An unholy additional armor save die or resistance that can only be negated by holy attacks & exorcism.
Pounce. If a surprise is successful, these creatures gain die ranks to their attack and a following effect of either a knockdown or a grapple. If that is successful, the target is at -1DR penalty to escape and the prey gets +1DR to their next turn’s attack. The DR amount can be based off a noted skill or via DRR.
Submerged. Increases defense with +1DR difficulty, but spears avoid this penalty, being able to pierce through water. Submerged crossbows are also effective. Venomous. Some creatures have a poisonous attack. This will add extra damage as 1DR or more and could cause the Affliction or Restrained condition. One can do a Prowess or Spirit test to resist the condition and halve the venomous damage.

GM Sanctioned. GM’s should prepare beasts with any abilities that make the foe unique. Base it on die ranks and simple effects or defenses during an encounter.
A GM should not add a new ability in the middle of combat or encounter even if it is a good idea. This plays out the limits of creatures and their ways. It also allows players to find weaknesses without the concern of something ‘new’ countering their creative choices. Keep it simple. Use the new idea for the next adventure!
The same beasts could have different abilities, each having honed in on any of the above. Feel free to play with the factors and add abilities befitting the creature’s experience and environment or just to add flavor. But keep it simple and balanced.

Swarm Rules	
Smaller creatures will swarm to become a threat. Here are some basic rules for it.
1.	For every 1 critter, add their Vigor.
2.	For every ‘mound’ or unit of critter beyond the 1st
•	Add one die rank to hit & damage.
•	Add 1 die rank to any fear or effects if apropos.
3.	Weakness. All mobs take additional damage from area effect attacks like fire or stomping boots. Double the dice rolled for damage.
Once 2 foes fall, based on the vigor factor, remove the same in bonuses. Optionally reduce bonuses by half or thirds equal to the vigor damage. One can limit any size mobs’ bonuses to +5DR to hit and d12 damage or whatever one feels, limiting their effective ability against a single target.

These foul vermin tend to be around evil. Sacrificial areas and ruins will have a few vicious ones and may even have a swarm of them. A great starter challenge that can easily escalate. Vampiric bats can sneak up on sleeping humans and surreptitiously incise a small wound that will bleed as it laps up blood.

•	The Nun’s Miracle of Healing can be used alone or combined with the rest.

Crawling Within	
Critters have a chance to get into brigandine or plate armor. Instead of attacking the first turn, do a Prowess or Aware roll off, if they roll higher, critters have crawled inside the armor to attack. They now have the Armor Save as they bite within, avoiding the Armor Save of the wearer! Creepy!
Could roll a Fear test by the wearer! Hah! Panic!

•	*Avoids armor saves due to small swarming nature
•	Gnats, wasps, spiders
•	Smoke, Fire should repel them
These foul vermin tend to be around evil: sacrificial areas, ruins or haunted places. They certainly have things they avoid like fire, smoke, water, bright lights etc... They can be summoned or infest an area.
Swarm of Gnats
Meant to be more a nuisance, not causing damage as noted above but can cause foul rashes and nagging bites that could give a -d4 until cleansed and soothed.
Swarm of Wasps
These fly and thusly can chase after a group. Fire, smoke and water will affect them normally while weapons only do half damage.
Swarm of Spiders
Frightful crawling arachnids that come right out of the ground, coffins or walls to leap and crawl over anyone. It may be difficult to hit them when they are on one’s own body? Half damage to them and half to oneself if struck? Rolling Prowess with rolling, smacking should do d6, damage or so if any are actually hit. If missed, the victim may lose 1 vitality them self due to exhaustive flailing.

Deer are wide spread and valuable food source for beasts and man. There is a wide variety of kinds with weaknesses and strengths. Noted here is an average deer. They can do a short burst horn attack, or if able, can charge increasing damage and possibly causing a fall which they can then stampede over. For larger beasts upgrade Prowess, Defense, Vigor, damage accordingly.

•	Bite+3, d4
•	Speed, Pack Attack +1DR
•	Bark, Keen Sense, Night Vision
•	Stealth +1DR in Forest, Stealth +2DR at Night
Wolves are a bane in ole dark Europe, especially in the forests and mountains. They won’t attack unless they can successfully set an ambush. If exposed or attacked before they ambush, they will likely flee.
This is the basic wolf stats, there can be a variety of wolf kinds, especially bigger and more terrifying ones.
Devil Dogs, black hounds	
Pro4, Awa3, Sav3, Spi2
•	Def15, Armor fur, Save d2, Vigor 9
•	Bite +4, d6
•	Fear Pro/Spi10, -1DR, if dark
Varieties of more dangerous wolves can exist in the Dark Ages. Rare, large, more ferocious versions can be utilized to create ‘devil dogs’ and fear amongst locals. Their eyes reflect torches, they can have darker fur, have more cunning, something to be rooted out by those willing to risk their lives to save others. These could also be trained by pagans to hunt farmers or lone travelers especially at night!
Lion or Tiger

Def14, Armor hide, Save d2, Vigor 18
•	Claws+6, d8+d4*, knockdown

•	Stealth +1DR, Roar Fear Pro/Spi14, near, -2DR
•	Lionesses +5 attacks but have Pack Attack +1DR
These are comparable to the bear as a predatory threat. Speed, stealth and lionesses, who hunt as a pack, certainly make them a bigger threat in warmer regions. In colder areas, the lions are more solitary and tiger like.

Knockdown Rule
•	To hit result must be resisted with Pro or one is knocked down. One may add their armor save to this resist!

•	Stealing+1DR, Distraction & Disguise+1DR
•	Stealth+1DR, Hide Objects+1DR
This network of town thieves will try to steal valuables off any newcomers. They may even be in liege with the town guards. There could be several, one distracting while the other steals. They will avoid fighting unless cornered.
Farmers have various dispositions, based on local pagan attitudes. But they are used to drum up support as mobs and can be a threat if enough gather and have a strong pagan leader.
Conversion: They are focused on their job and may fear their boss more than a preacher or his word. Deal with the boss to really get to them. They can have an average CL roll, but again, they will fear whomever has told them what to do. If converted, they will return any items stolen, as long as they are not edible.
Farmer, villager & mob

•	Bow+3, d6, lethal6
Typical ruffians or thugs along the roads of the countryside or used as local enforcement. They are all pagan, hungry, greedy, and violent. All will have daggers, half will have axes, the other bows. These are the lowliest of criminal elements with the least amount of skill or aptitude or fettered by addictions and other malevolencies.
Conversion: These roll the {d8, d8}keep lowest to determine their CL. But if converted, they will need to be fed well. They may then join for a local mission if paid or given aid, especially for their family.
Brigand, Bandit, Rogue	
Pro3, Awa2, Sav2, Spi-1, Int1, Soc1 Def14, Armor leather, Save d4, Vigor 12

•	One: weapon +1DR to hit, Parry +1DR
These are tougher ruffians, seasoned and capable. They may ambush along the roads of the countryside or be used as local enforcement. They are all pagan, hungry, greedy, and violent. These may be leaders of ruffians or a dangerous gang in their own right. They can also be hired by pagan leaders for expediency.
Conversion: They are on the road to do evil, so the typical {d8, d8}keep lowest. They have done criminal acts and feel the guilt and shame of it weighing upon them. They use anger and mistrust to hide it.

Run small towns as local sheriff. Will have small garrison of town guards. Conversion: Varies but usually loyal to local lords and follows their beliefs.
	RolePlaying	
Many encounters, especially in civilized areas, will not require one to have a fully created character. These are meant to be dealt with in a role-playing manner.
Pick a few skills or areas they’d have a +2 or +4 trait and skills at +1DRor +2DR. These can be impromptu, immediately assigning it for the first roll the players want to do against them.
Give them secondary knowledge or skills where they will have a +1 or +2 at, and maybe a +1DR. Again, as the GM assign the next series of rolls these skills. Most locals will utilize their skills and only their skills, ignoring or moving along if the encounter isn’t akin to their business or daily routines.
If they are in the element or have a militia behind them, you might want to add a DR or two and give them +3DR or +4DR to intimidate or rebuff or control crowds. If they are in their fancy shop and have busy workers all around them or have their best dress on, they may get that DR bonus.
Entering a great hall with advisors and servants all around, will give a local Duke some pomp and royal bonuses that one must overcome to persuade, convince or get on one’s side.
What missionaries must do is figure out how to gain more appeal to the Duke, to the locals. Each individual will have an agenda, some fun quirks or attitudes the GM should play off. Have fun as the GM, getting to act these roles, giving them outward attitudes and secret agendas. Allow them to be flustered, angry, giving away clues or to be distant, cold, calculating and conniving a plot against the saints.
Generally, the setting of this game, have a pagan leader amidst the settlement. This magician or witch will have sought to either climb the ranks to advisor or personal healer or sage to the Duke or whoever is in charge. So these will be counter forces to the Christian momentum.
When missionaries can accomplish tasks, adventurous challenges that either weaken a plot or rescue those in dour situations, things can change. But until they prove themselves, most locals will be adverse and stubborn to change or evangelism. They will have more connection with their local pagan leader than any new missionaries.
Christians can certainly try to go in and straight away attempt evangelism. It should be harder with many being suspicious of this new monotheism coming in to change their traditions and ways.

Captain Jerkhouen and his militia travel the roads to the next campaign. Stay out of their way! They may take whatever foods or items they deem necessary for supplies! Hopefully the Christians will not pray in earnest, causing the Captain to suffer some event that then makes them hastily return the confiscated items and beg forgiveness!
The merchants of any village are in the know, concerning pagan plots of advantage over others, wanting life cheats when it comes to success and materialism. But most may have a chance to seek forgiveness if their greedy world is upturned, their plots exposed as evil. But until then, they will scorn, mock, scoff and tut-tut any challenge to their worldview.
Reminder: Conversion shouldn’t really have a chance at success until after some important factor has been removed, or a dire, violent situation has been overcome!
Concerning blasphemy	
I, StorytellingRon, don’t consider it blasphemy to mock or counter the role-playing of evangelism in this game. The pagans would and should mock and scoff at what the players say in evangelism. However, as the GM, playing the pagans, one should keep it more PG or PG13... with the mocking having limits and being in the form of mocking questions that the players can respond to and literally work out their evangelism.
A GM should certainly be careful and the best way is to limit the mocking to one or two odd comments. Defiant witches and angry mobs will certainly say foul things and one can act out the fun, family parts and then describe it when it gets more bitter and contentious.

Dressing as beasts and living like them, they seem to have changed their physical form. Some would say they truly are beasts! They have turned to torture and cannibalism and can be found serving pagan cults, shamans and witches.
Conversion: Too far gone, having consorted with witches & demons, only through pure defeat and violent submission may some survivors be given the chance to see their power as fragile. They are at CL1!
Pagans will use some sort of altar or location to perform rituals and give sacrifices. This will generally be the focus of their power and fanaticism. They will defend it, though not always to the death. Some may hesitate or surrender and see if the altar or idol itself will stop or punish any Christians who attempt to knock it down or demolish it.
These altars, shrines, cairns, markers or other sites are central to the pagan plots and should be the climatic turning point of each session. These spots could also reveal any dispensing of concoctions to beasts or what criminal grift is occurring.
Locals will fear the spot to the point of not wanting to reveal the location, hiding it from any inquiry or interrogation. Locals will certainly fear any retribution if the sacred spots are destroyed.
 
 The Horned Ones Kult 
A cult of mongrels who have resorted to primal behaviors. They hunt and sacrifice the local deer population for their weapons, hides and ‘horns’. They build altars and encase their strongest human sacrifices inside a large ‘demonic’ form to worship and instill fear amongst the rest.
They are mercurial in nature, working under greater more civilized leaders who craft their Ancient Horned One leader and set up whatever scheme they want. It usually involves slaves, mining or any other laborious operation. The local leaders look the other way and take the profit.
A sorcerer is usually the contact between these and any duke or merchant in business with them.

The Horned Ones are given fervor and fear by their leader. They cover themselves in antler, bones and deer hide. They prefer stealth, ambush and fear to overcome enemies and poor villagers. They are slavers of the weak and use them for whatever purpose they have in the forests and mines.
Conversion: These are at CL1... But if denouement is at play, they will raise to CL4! The Horned Ones are fortunately the youngest and most foolish of the fanatics so there is some chance to break them down and change their dark hearts.

A larger horned one leading the others. Could be guarding an area or entrance. They are not leaders so much as brutes used to encourage the smaller ones or to keep them in line.
Conversion: Oddly some could be converted. They are big and burly and are given the role of scary security. Some could be very cruel and brutal, wanting to only impress their master. They are at CL1! But food may be a factor in conversion! Especially rich foods.
The goal isn’t always to vanquish the ones who cause fear and terror, but perhaps, getting them to surrender. There is still hope to save them. One can gain new allies and saved souls to help plant, build and grow the church. And whilst one moves on, they remain to protect the growing parish.

A shaman or priest has ‘sacrificed’ himself to be possessed and ‘entombed’ in the trappings of fur and bone, and the skull of a large elk. The shaman may or may not be a corpse within. Either the shaman possessed commands the cultists or being dead, an evil spirit controls it and leads the Horned Ones. It sits at an altar, appearing part of it until it is disturbed by Christians nearby. Then it will rise and destroy any followers of Christ.

These giant flightless birds are sometimes considered frightful dragons.

Few venture to these high places to dare the terrain, goats and giant birds. But on occasion these beasts will venture into the lowlands to terrorize and hunt locals and their livestock.
If given food, they will return on occasion expecting more or will take whatever they can, usually violently.

Large reptilian beasts have limits to where they can thrive. The large swathes of warm regions are ever being encroached by men and their desire for comforts.

	Cavefolk, Dark Dwellers	
These savage folk have secluded themselves into dark remote caves and worship the dark shadows that play upon their cave walls. They are simple and rustic, disregarding the outside world, except to steal or murder in the darkest of nights.
Some might believe them to be kobolds or goblins, eerie malnourished gangly creatures who hide in the shadows.
They can be converted but with much difficulty and probably with some propensity to violence to subdue their dark evil upbringing.
Their witch certainly seduces them with dark tales around a cave fire, creating shadows on the wall and performing rituals thereof to keep them in the dark.
Fight in the Dark
First, roll the cavefolks stealth in the dark to create a difficulty the missionaries must overcome to even sense them. Also attacking them in the dark for this setting is at -5DR, but the DRR of that roll may reduce that by die ranks. So if a holy knight rolls above their stealth total he will sense them. And based on how much he succeeds at hearing or sensing the cavefolk the normal -5DR rolls in the dark can be reduced by the DRR.

Dark Ritual, she performs shadowy stories and dances to keep them as dark cave dwelling zealots. They have senses in the dark and have a +DRR to their denouement! This is also done in preparation for moonless night raids.

Forest nymphs, faeries and trolls are pagans who relish the forest and the capability of hiding in it for stealth and ambush. They consider themselves part of the forest spirits and act accordingly. They attempt to cause fear at a distance, making anyone without courage feel a panic induced fear due to their creepy camouflaged movements.
Drugs, rituals and other mind and spirit altering zealotry have lead these to believe they are one with the forest, the protectors, the servants or what have you.
Non-believers are prime targets for expulsion or sacrifice.
They will have a witch or sorcerer as their leader and crafter of any poisons made from forest ingredients. Not all nymphs necessarily live in the forest. These may be local farmers,villagers or leaders who have some motive to control or keep their forest land for their own benefit. Some may have somewhat innocent or innocuous intentions, while others may be quite devious.
For the more insidious they will have ingredients gathered from the local forest. A source of mushrooms could give them powers or ritual enhancements. Some root may have the poisonous or healing effects they wish to covet for themselves. A powerful ingredient the witch wishes to keep Savret may be the at the center of this group. It could also be a ruin or treasure or other valuable site.

These trolls are not the giant trolls but are cult warriors adorned with garb to look and make them feel like forest trolls. They are zealot warriors whose large bulky headdresses make them feel invulnerable and thusly a bit more fanatical.
Getting into the roles, they’ll grunt and growl and otherwise seem to lose their sanity for the role. Some may be warriors, some may be old power hungry losers, it will be a difficult task for the missionaries to subdue and discern.

They over swing and stomp about hollering and howling, causing fear into anyone without the Spirit. They are used by the witches for their rituals, to reinforce their tyranny over others by guarding and participating.

The Bite Curse is rumored to make one turn into a wolf. Generally the victim is diseased and could die from it. If one survives, in their delirium they are given ‘medicines’ by the shaman and rituals to turn them into wolfmen. This is a ritualistic, rite of passage for their warriors.
The ritual weakens the will of the sick and feeble minded. It can feed into the anger of those full of rage, promising them violent power!
During combat, if a wolfman doe bite a victim, it will take them out of the fight for d4 turns. It generally only does this if other warriors are fighting.

Dressing as wolves and behaving thusly, they seem to have changed their physical form. Some would say they truly are wolves! They are empowered by rituals and war dances.
Conversion: Too far gone, having consorted with witches & demons, only through pure defeat and violent submission may some survivors of their own violence be given the chance to see their power as fragile.
This culture of warriors use lycanthrope as their tool, their secret weapon of fear to conquer and enslave others. They will have villages with trappings of wolf heads, fur, claws and more. They will have plenty of slaves and show much contempt for any outsiders. It would seem the men, women and children are enthralled to their culture of the wolf.

	Woodelf, woodfolk, forestfolk	
This cult tribe is... woody. They love wood! Well they like forests and nymph like things. They could be in tandem with or warriors of the nymph types or have their own backwood tribe. They could be normal, but during rituals or for battle, dress up like this.
They’re goal is to be frightening and stick to a theme. They could have normal weapons but also crazy primitive wood, bone and stone ones. These folks have hidden away in the dark forests of the Tuetoberg and have gone fully wild, primitive, barbaric or deceptively genius.
Others fear these forests and/or avoid these crazies and that is the way they like it. They are pagan and will have some dark oppressive religious beliefs.
Forest cover and stealth	
All woodfolk get a +d6 to stealth and for defense when not in combat or at melee range. They can also use +d6 for maneuvering in forests, tracking, noticing things, hunting and gathering. (However we Christians do not believe in the hunter/gatherer theory!)
If they succeed at stealth, they can charge or snipe and get a +d4 to attack and damage on the first attack.

	Skull Kult	
The Skull Kult can be any cult group in any area. They can be living in remote desolate lands, in swamps on isolated isles or in the heart of a town or city! They can be an agrarian cult that desires better harvest and livestock or a merchant cult who seeks to undermine other business with unfair pagan practices.
Whatever the case, the Skull Kult can be used as a far reaching religion that has taken on the mantle of underground pagan worship adverse to the Church and the new ways. It’s source can be slavic or ancient Greek coming from the isle of Crete where the minotaur once reigned.
If the members are the merchants, farmers and businessmen, the warriors will be their hired hands or hired goons to protect them during these gatherings.

Scarification, this ritual will heal any fire wounds, but will certainly make the afflicted flesh quite ugly and scarred. There’s a good chance this was used on the magician himself!
Fire resistance, a preparation done for a leader or warrior, giving them some resistance to this magician’s powers. The purpose being they can fight as the magician casts fire attacks.
