Grandeminister’sGuide
The second part of this book is for the Grande Minister (or game master or GM). It is a guide and supplement on setting and encounters and how to make modular customizable encounter maps.
This game is generally mission based. So the GM should prepare the adventure around a specific mission the missionaries need to do.
The basic premise is to go to a certain village or settlement and plant a church. That entails going there and engaging the local population and leaders in some form. The following sections are charts and lists to help to determine the level of opposition and what may be encountered before one can peacefully establish a church in the area.
The initial investigation should generally start the challenges and intrigue. The missionaries will discover these and must figure out how to overcome them. There is always a possibility of conversion at every level however the degree of difficulty should always increase, to the point that some, especially the leader types, will be violently adverse to any conversion or Christianizing of the land and people they have dominion over.
The main game and storyline is a pre-set mission to travel to an area, discover the pagan plot, disrupt it and persuade the locals to support the planting of a church.
So basically:
•	Prepare a village or settlement on paper or with some map pieces of homes and buildings.
•	Set up some non-player characters with varying degrees of tolerance and hatreds. They will be local craftsmen, farmers, villagers and miscreants. If encouraged or pushed may provide clues to what is amiss. These can have a few skills, main traits and their own agendas, fears or concerns.
•	Have a few villains around to confront the Christians, decide their level of evil or potential good. Make them more prone to threats and violence. This can be a fun lowly combat encounter where they will quickly surrender & convert or retreat to increase the suspense for later.
•	Prepare a pagan site with map pieces where locals come to worship and submit. It can be a creepy grove or lost temple or cavernous space with an altar.
•	Prep a pagan leader, a witch or shaman. These will have a 1 or 2 magics for persuading the locals, 1 or 2 for controlling their goons and 1 or 2 for curses and self empowerment that they gain directly with their altar or place of worship and is generally a ritual to prepare goons for a final showdown.
•	Prep a tough brute or possibly a scary pet beast.
•	The missionaries must vanquish or weaken the pagan leaders and their enforcers. There are tables in this guide to help determine if a pagan leader can be saved or not.
•	Destroy the altar or sacred place and reveal to the people that the pagans are not as powerful as God’s servants. Through Christ, they do not need to sacrifice or be enslaved to other men. This can open the door to evangelize the locals and setup a church. In most cases this will be a few preaching roles and emotional role-playing. Certainly encourage some actual preaching and some pagan questions and responses. It is best to keep it light and simple, fun and enjoyable.
•	This is where the missionaries can heal their wounds, role-play any new upgrades as in learning new blessings or skills. They can get gear repaired and rest for many days, building the church and securing the region for the Faith.
•	They will then learn of new threats or news beyond the parish, that they must go and evangelize!
•	If the GM feels it’s warranted and/or the rolls are so bad, the local people could reject the Christians and threaten them, usurp all they’ve done or force them to flee
•	Rarely this could occur in the game, but it must be noted that this happened historically when monks were killed, a militant wing of the Church could respond to the violent paganism. This can be roleplayed as a new threat where new pagan leaders come to openly thwart the efforts of the church or locals reveal their own evil intentions.
When Missionaries Argue
Christians seem to love to disagree, which can lead to arguments. At some point the story needs to progress. Have each roll their strongest trait to persuade. Warriors will use their Prowess Trait to intimidate. Rogues may use their Awareness or Savvy as persuasive tools. Clergy will exhort or rebuke with their Spirit Trait. Patron Ladies will charm or lead with their social skills. Whoever rolls the highest wins the argument and all must go with that plan, willingly or not.
At the GM’s discretion, one may get a die bonus if the situation befits their trait, if it is a combat encounter Prowess, if it is against evil spirits, it’s Spiritual, if it is in a royal court, it would be Social and so forth and so on.

On compelling ‘upgrades’
For a story driven game, there may be an experience or event that upgrades a character or their gifts in some way. A warrior may have an epic battle that then gives them an attachment to their weapon and it becomes +1. A nun may have survived a sacrificial act with a gruesome scar that gives her one inspired d4 per day. A lady patron drops a rock out of her cart with such great success it may become a unique +d4 skill. Something nuanced or overt can give them an odd bonus to an item or specific skill as a reward for the intense, incredible experience. GM’s discretion!

Naming the NPC
Folks’ names have a mix of Roman and Germanic Longbeards or Lombards. If the character is a minor character played by the GM, just use the Min or minion first syllable adding any ending vowel or consonant to it. For craftsmen and reputable workers, a middle sections is added. And for lords, nobles, dire villain and clergy all three parts make their name. Choose to roll from either table. Roll a d20 accordingly, adding each part.

Noted historical encounters & accounts in the Dark Ages: The Devil, angels, demons, saints, telepathic powers, prophesy, demonic possession in humans, animals and swarms of insects, raising the dead back to life, soothsaying, divination, augury reading, dragons, evil spirits, sacred trees.
Some pagan activities were sought even by so called Christians: explaining misfortune, warnings or assurances (divination, augury), curing sickness, stimulating love interest, vengeance, taking a journey, interpreting patterns in nature like weather, animal activities or deformities.
Ariolus is an altar of idols for deadly sacrifice to accept instruction from a swarm of demons.
There are many writings of bishops complaining of many pagan practices within Christian lands. And there are many missionaries who were killed.
It has been noted that in Paris alone, in the 14th century, there were 30,000 sorcerers and much more witches. What may it have looked like in the country side? It is time for missionaries to get busy!

Demonic Activity & Evil Spirits	
Pagan leaders continually seek to draw demons to this world for their own mad drive for power and tyranny. Demons, fallen angels, dark angels, shadows, evil spirits are everywhere and continually call to pagans to do their bidding.
Worshiping demons gives them powers to possess humans, animals, swarms of insects, dead bodies and inanimate objects. Pagans will place dead guards in their tombs and temples knowing demons as evil spirits could possess these bodies and animate them as undead. They will have created rituals, drawn symbols and sacrificed animals for these type of guards.
Evil spirits can possess willing or sacrificed pagans, turning them into monstrous being of great strength and animalistic fervor. One might call these trolls or ogres, though there are listings for giant types. When demons possess animals, they are turned to feral beasts with rabid strength and ferocity. They can animate trees or add black magic abilities to things. They can control vermin and insects, summoning terrifying swarms.
All fantastical and horrifying abominations of God’s creation are enacted by the possession of demons. They generally only do this when pagans utilize their black magic to draw them to this world with sacrifices.
While demonic possessions should generally fit into real world creatures, certainly demons can appear as abominable creations that terrify the beholder. The level of horror and scare effects should be limited to the players and audience tolerance of such things.
For more family friendly, especially for younger children, the ‘possessions’ can be more of an effect of anger and selfishness. Pagans could be thieves, bullies and other things, using scary costumes and props to scare the locals, which was quite common.
As the players get older or more intrigued, stronger elements of demonic interference can be added as layers to a growing story.
Much of the creatures and challenges added here are from Biblical or Christian historical accounts with flavoring to fit role-playing game mechanics. For the main game and setting, the demonic powers have been ‘subdued’ to feral and ferocious temperaments. Additional supplements may explore and extrapolate on more dire demonic manifestations for the more grim and fantastical Christian role-playing fans.
 
cultureofpaganism
1.	Any god but God
Pagans are innately tolerable of other people’s gods. They like when gods are shared, stories are shared, even rituals and powers. What they don’t tolerate, is the view there’s only one Creator and they will be held accountable for who they are, for their actions. What they do like is that they can commit atrocities, then offer material sacrifices to manipulative priests and feel sanctimonious.
2.	Many idols & Stories
Pagans worship anything they can make up, whether statues of men or creatures, odd symbols or icons, trees, anything material that seems awe inspiring. Fear and emotions are useful tools to worship in this way. It is about a ritual of sacrificing to this thing and creating stories that empower them to gain followers, fame or fortune.
3.	Blaspheming and Sacrilege
Pagans do not mind insulting and swearing, even to children. Their care and consideration are practically null outside their own family. Many pagans have blood feuds for generations simply due to the fact that they continually insult and demean each other, their wives and children. This also spills over in how they treat others. Some may call for mutual respect, but if slighted, could easily turn to mocking & scoffing.
4.	No Rest For the Weary
Pagans have no compunction to let their slaves rest, to allow their followers any moment of respite. Day after day they enforce their tyranny upon others. After all they create their own gods. Aside from their own festivals, each day is another strung out day of fighting for power and controlling others. They could not bear their own slaves having one day to rest and worship God.
5.	Tribe Over Family
Pagans are more about gang warfare than family. Women are chattel, children are tribal property. Boys are forced to be warriors and raiders. All men are subject to the chief. The women are property and treated terribly, practically slaves. If it wasn’t for their beauty and a desire by the men to have some moments of peace, the women would have no life at all. Family is only sacred to the warrior class and the leaders. All else are subject to them.


6.	Selfish Desires
Pagans deal with others only for their own gain. They will lie, cheat, steal, murder and conquer in anyway for gain. Many say they will keep their word, but that’s as long as they are too weak to do otherwise, hoping the other will do the same. Some might be ‘noble’, but only for selfish reasons, and that can change on a whim.
7.	Deceivers
Pagans who are unsure of the situation will always come off as friendly and helpful. Once they have had time to conspire and know they have the advantage, their true nature will come forth.
Pagans can certainly lie. Why not? They can bear false witness whether against their own brother or to betray others. They’ll cause blame of their own acts upon their enemies. If there is no absolute truth or a Truth Giver, than any lie is the truth to pagans. There is no limit to their lies and false accusations.
8.	Coveters
Pagans love to steal, take and conquer others. They can be industrious, but many of their religions say to go and die in battle, to be furious, and to steal. It is their highest honor, if that were the right word, to kill others and take their stuff.
9.	In their own Works
Pagans do believe they are essentially good and that whatever evil they do is out done by the good they’ve done, the sacrifices they’ve made and the rituals to their gods they’ve performed. They believe that their evil acts will be outweighed by the care, charity and honorable things they’ve done. They believe that by what they do, they will go to paradise and be amongst the gods and their ancestors and that they determine their own fate, not their made up gods.
10.	In summary
Most pagans think they are good, want to be good, act good most of the time. They’ll help, they’ll care, they’ll be considerate. The above behaviors have to do with when they are being challenged, confronted or have been cornered into making a choice. There is no foundational discipline that requires them to be loving, kind, charitable or forgiving. In the end it is what is to their best advantage. Most have no idea that their corruption enslaves them all. They are unaware they need a savior.

Early catholic premise	
The Church and catholic or universal church in this game is not like the Catholic Church & debate we have today. It is more in line with the early writings of the founding church members and their Christian writings as well as the New Testament instructions on setting up a church with a pastor, bishop or priest. Much of modern Catholic doctrine was not developed till 1000AD or later.
The theology and evangelism of this game should be kept simple and fun and Catholics and Orthodox are welcome.
The basic premise of each mission is to be asked to investigate or evangelize a new area. There, the clergy should discover and confront pagan activities. A confrontation will ensue whether it can be resolved with preaching or met with some level of violence. Once the major pagan plot is thwarted, conversion of locals and church planting can begin. The missionaries are then rewarded with Glory Points to upgrade skills.
General Clergy Breakdown	
Clergy & Missionaries
Monk, Friar, Cleric, Priest, Preacher, Brother, Porter Ministers

Popes During this Period	
Pope successions
John III (561-574), Benedict (575-579), Pelagius II (579-590) Pope Gregory the Great (590-604)
Roman senator’s son, a prefect at 30, then monastic until he became a papal ambassador to Constantinople. He then became pope. He paid the Lombards not to besiege Rome.
Successions: Sabinian, Boniface III, IV, V, Adeodatus I, Honorius I, Severinus, John IV, Theodore I, St. Martin I St. Eugne, St. Vitalian...
Spain becomes fully Catholic in 589 after much persecution by the Arianist heresy. Leaders & bishops converted. For simplicity, Arianist mixed Christian and Pagan beliefs.

Parish	
This refers to the church, its members and their activities in the local area.
Monastery	
Successfully converting local lords will gain financial gifts in coin & land for monasteries. These are where monks and nuns have given their life over to Christ. Remote ones are prime targets for pagan raiders and are usually defenseless. In a land full of Christian culture these can flourish and become places of support for the missionaries, but in remote areas and along coasts and borders, they could be sites to protect and if lost, investigate.
Each one can be very different. Each will have monks or nuns, each with skills in healing and some crafts from humble farming to superior workmanship. They can be a source for missions, church support, healing & rest and a setting for an adventure.
Academia	
Generally in larger cities and near the growing establishment of churches (not yet cathedrals) & monasteries, these buildings house clergy who see a role in understanding history and education. They collect all manner of works to archive history and understand the world around them. These will be a source of learning for academia, lore, crafting, the learning of magical realms and the lore of evil things. Scholars and wizards (wizened ones) may abide here.
Church	
The center of the Christian faith in each area is a building acquired or erected. These are not yet cathedrals but many may be temples of former pagans, Roman villas or a series of homes donated. The clergy reside in living quarters here and pastor all about them, as well as teach and send out missionaries.
There will always be a need, however dire, by the clergy of each local church.
Temple, Tomb, Cemetery	
Many of the more established villages, towns and cities will have old pagan temples and tombs. These locations can easily be sources of dungeon delving adventure. Rome had hundreds of years of powerful people creating and obsessing over burial sites and worship in dark, vile, esoteric, hidden places!

Gaining glory points during rest	
In addition to gaining glory points for planting a church, during a time of peace and spending glory points, missionaries may attempt to bear some fruit for the church locally.
•	preaching
•	helping around town
•	training the soldiers on proper behavior
•	engaging the local lord or leader
•	helping widows & orphans
•	setting up a monastery
•	setting up an orphanage
•	setting up a hospital
•	setting up a hospice
•	setting up a school
If a missionary, during down time, whilst the church is being planted and situated, as they await abbots and ministers, wishes to bear fruit, to do some good works, they may describe and roleplay things to accomplish. They should elaborate on all aspects to accomplish this task, as in engaging locals, financing, logistics and so forth. Whatever can convince the GM of successfully completing this task.
The GM will conversely come up with difficulties or any resistance. Both descriptions bearing DRs to the player’s roll and to the GM’s final difficulty total. If successful, a DRR is then finalized and one may roll on the Missionary Support table for a reward.

Missionary Support, DRR	
1.	Gain an inspired die
2.	Gain the DR rolled as trinkets, for trade in the next mission.
3.	Gain the DR rolled in inspired die.

On ‘Conversion’ & Mission	
Conversion for this game doesn’t mean they have come to Christ fully. It means they have had a change of heart and are willing to listen and allow a church to be established. Historically, while there were great and true conversions, many were forced or pressured to accept Christian ways. This is completely appropriate since the important factor was to civilize the pagans and setup a church so the locals could then learn from pastoral teaching and fellowship.
The basic premise of the game is to discern, discover, deploy, defeat and drive out the pagan influences. Once done, the ministers could build a church and preach conversion, Christian ethics, theology, reading the Bible.
For game purposes, whatever the tactic, there should always be pagan resistance or a pagan plot to do the same or to have already been established. Each mission should find the missionaries facing intrigue and opposition.
Defeating the local pagan leadership is the best way to open up the locals to conversion. There can be many levels of conversion, some being a peaceful resolve to an intense encounter. Others can be a conversion that has the pagans helping the missionaries or at least staying out of their way.
In history, many missionaries converted the lords who then supported monasteries and churches that influenced the local population.
With that success, the missionaries can rest and heal up. During this time, they can learn about other pagan threats nearby, explore to find them or be assigned their next mission via correspondence with papal or church authorities.

Availability, in general	
Small village would have a smith, tanner, farmers and maybe a few others like rope-maker and cobbler at best.
A larger town would have most of the rest except alchemist, perfumist, physician and parchment maker who would be at cities like Milan and Rome.
A merchant or trader could be present in these smaller settlements or along the road. A good Society roll may garner replenishments or needed gear. Patron ladies will have some social benefits. All others must roll their trade vs the Merchant’s to afford what they need.
If the merchant is favorable to the clergy, they may be able to use their Spirit roll to get some needed supplies, but nothing too fancy.

	PaganhexCrawl	
Hex as in witch! Use these various tables to determine the activities and agenda of locals & pagan cabals and how they will react to missionaries.

Below is a way for the GM to prep a mission, to give ideas and direction that the GM can work within, creating the opposition, their activities, motives and disposition.
The goal is to Christianize the land, to pacify settlements in accepting the planting of a church. It is to thwart the movement of pagans and the forces of darkness. DR: Some tables have DR to determine which die to roll. This represents the GM deciding to start easy, 1DR or d4, and advancing up to 5DR or d12. Use d4 for beginning games, keeping the options less harrowing, then d6, d8, d10, d12 as the missionaries become more capable.
Local Pagan Activity, DR	
There is always certain individuals leading the pagan rituals in the area. The list below provides the main focus or power structure. For new players, only roll a d4. Add die ranks to the roll as the party progresses in glory points and experience.
1.	Runs & owns the statues and groves where trinket offerings to local spirits or ancestors are placed.
2.	Criminal group posing as demonic or superstitious activity.
3.	Manipulative charlatans act as spiritual leaders

11.	Ancient site of horrifying rituals, haunted!? Or great beast lair! Pick a beast legend trope!
12.	Demon or powerful beast is haunting & corrupting the land. Roll D8 + 4 for support network. If result of 12, add some powers to it or its lair or presence.
To determine the strength of the pagans, base it off what the missionaries can handle. Start with weak opposition to get a feel for how many they can handle and how close the fight or struggle was. Build up each encounter to be a tad tougher with different challenges and tactics.
Look to use one or two black magic pagan powers that could increase the suspense and danger. Make sure to use annoying, fun and harrowing pagans who sneer, leer, jeer and scoff at the Christians.
Consider the locale and what resources the pagans might have for manpower, the quality of that but also, do the pagans expect opposition or have they gone soft, expecting all to comply to their pagan grift.

Pagan Motive of the Leader, DR	
Pagan Activity below an 8, can roll here to see how far the leaders have gone toward the darkness and what they are seeking. Roll a d8. Or roll a d4 or d6 for beginner games. Or up to d12 to push for worse and worse stuff!
1.	Good intentions, no really! Just didn’t know.
2.	Just desperate, might do more if no other way, frail
3.	Seeks riches through manipulation, a bit haughty and self serving, nothing a reality check can’t fix

5.	Finding influence seeks power (enforcers), has zealots, getting zealot! Must negate zealot buffer!
6.	Finding power seeks black magic, kind of gone, knows their power is evil now
7.	Finding black magic seeks demonic power, uh yeah...
8.	Finding demonic power realizes own damnation and are obsessed with tyranny and deception even unto themselves!

modus operandi, d6	
This list helps one further understand the style of play one could use for the pagans, the culture, look, attitude and behavior. This intensifies as one gets closer to the leadership.
1.	Lust. These pagans are looking to seduce and exploit anyone whose weak in morals and lure them to their own beautiful idols, pageantry and pomp.
2.	Manipulative: curses others, makes beasts feral, causes a ‘dark god’ problem that only they can ‘cure’.
3.	Vengeance: hates someone in the village, wants to slowly ruin them by torturing their souls, hurting their loved ones and destroying their reputation and wealth
4.	Greed: Coin and treasures are the goal, stealing and taking from locals, they want riches through criminal activity. It could be a con or through intimidation and force.
5.	Pure Malice: The desire for violence, death, destruction, especially by their followers and in ritualistic sacrifice, pure chaotic evil.

•	Roll on the Family Friendly Paganism, DR. This can give the over arching intensity level of how the pagans act. It can be tied in with main activity or the culture and behavior of locals, or both.
•	Roll on the Side Quests & Flavor, d12 for extra stuff, random.
•	Roll on Real Plot, d6 to see what’s really going on.
•	Roll on Additional Flavor, d12 for extra descriptives or smaller encounters that aren’t connected with any other plot, for the most part.
•	Cursed Table, d12 is optional to add something scarier, haunting, it is usually isolated but could be tied in with anything apropos.
•	Possibilities, d6 help shore up the Cursed Table’s cause or fulfillment.
‘family friendly’ paganism, DR
This can be a refinement or clarification of pagan activities. Still violent options, but sexual content removed. This can help with lessons, debate, arguments in evangelism. Each higher step includes the lower activities.
1.	Friendly white magic healing and frivolities
2.	White magic to heal, whilst using black magic to harm, they are probably the cause of local ailments, that they then offer to cure and gain influence.
3.	Bullying and Cursing Others for gain, for conversion. They will align with the most recalcitrant or trouble makers or greediest to weasel their way into positions of control, authority, ownership over others.
4.	Using rituals, readings, preachings amongst locals to control them, beguile them, extort or offer solutions to problems they usually cause. Or if there is an outside problem they may align with it. They will appease, acquiesce, cede to whatever is more tyrannical.
5.	Using potions (drugs) as advantage over others, they are definitely alchemists or herbalists crafting such. These can benefit any of the stats usually having an addictive and destructive effect.
6.	Animal sacrifice, cruelty to animals will pervade amongst their shrines and altars. Undoubtedly a cruelty and sadism will pervade amongst them, especially the leaders and zealots.
7.	Ruining others crops, property, wealth via potions, rituals, curses, vandalism, criminal activity and/or fear creates a culture of high stakes criminality. The prosperity of clans or houses without a foundational charity will breed strife. Since there is no forgiveness, the cycle of vengeance will be for generations and pervasive.
8.	Intimidation, gang like, vandalism, theft, terrorizing, a step further along then 7, it has become a destructive culture devolving from a semblance of citizenry to one of barbarity. All out clan wars is inevitable. Taking sides is expected or else!
9.	Slavery, of own or others, for gain has created something of an empire or clan with a purpose. That is of slavery with many auction and slave houses, blacksmiths making shackles and worse, and prison wagons and more. The business of slavery has pervaded the land!
10.	Blood thirsty gladiatorial arenas and slave filled circuses. To all they have accepted the worthlessness of human life, as offerings to their lust for entertainment.
11.	Outright murder, conquest, slavery, end goal of tyranny, a decaying culture all around with bloated temple priesthoods and clans hiding away knowing murder and backstabbing is the norm.
12.	Outright human sacrifice. If too much for players, resort to 11. Or could be rare or just clues of one done awhile ago, want to do again. Or one who ‘willingly’ sacrificed themselves.

	localdisposition	
Conversion Level (CL), d8	
Use two d8 keep lowest, for really evil stuff! The numbers equate to DR for DRR.

1.	Violently Evil. Will seek ways to attack outsiders as ambush or thuggery or if surprised. They run the area openly or with skulduggery. +5DR resist! If these resist, it is permanent, not Chosen.
2.	Manipulative Evil. Will use violence to enslave if at great advantage. Otherwise portrays themselves as victims. Beyond salvation, only something violent and extreme could get them to instead serve the Church. Betrayal is never far away from these lost souls. A strong Church could keep them in check, somewhat.
+4DR resist!
3.	Evil as Chaff, tends toward selfish needs, can be manipulated. Tends not to use violence, like a greedy merchant, but will if they can get away with it. They surrender to save their own skin. They have feelings of worthlessness, if affirmed, may lead them to conversion, but rare is the soul in this group that is Chosen. +3DR resist!
4.	Neutral Evil, very suspicious, cautious, defensive, prone to outbursts of violence then shame. Something calamitous or profitable could sway them to more evil. Their anger is destroying them. Will they be called to freedom? +2DR resist.
5.	Sinners, having resorted to evil, do not like it. Open to an answer. They feel guilty. They will avoid helping anyone for fear of retribution. Their greatest fear & love needs to be revealed to them.
6.	Listeners, having heard the answer, knows there must be an answer, seeks it. Still defensive, still apprehensive and fears Evil all too well. A great preaching or selfless act may help.
7.	Considering the faith, seen Christians at work, has had positive run ins with the Church. Still holds to old ways, could fall back into evil pagan practices but certainly hoping for a better way. Seeing successes against pagan threats could bring these out.
8.	Christian. Fully committed to the Christian faith, loves it and Jesus and seeks to learn more and help out of possible. Will not join in adventure but would help defend, be a source of information and warning, and could provide logistical help.
Reminder: Conversion shouldn’t really have a chance at success until after some important factor has been removed, or a dire, violent situation has been overcome!
 
	Pagan Activity examples	
1.	Runs & owns the statues and groves where trinket offerings to loxcal spirits or ancestors are placed.
Local woman thinks she’s spiritual. She finds it easy enough to charm locals with soothsaying, mixtures and rituals. She may resort to hiring local thugs to threaten missionaries for impeding her business.
2.	Criminal group posing as demonic activity
A more sordid small group with costumes lurks about causing real terror while getting locals to give sacrifices at groves and altars. Can be cowardly or prone to violence. It may intensify when a real sorceress is attracted to their activities and joins or exploits them.
3.	Manipulative charlatans act as spiritual leaders
Merchants or any other connivers have set up their temple or grove and are gathering followers, wealth and power. They are intimidating local residents. Any resistance makes them resort to haunting, cursing, and eventual violence.
4.	Feared local beast or brute treated as idol, usually with local shamanic or druidic advisor
A beast has grown to prominence and is used to getting a meal by the locals. They revere it as a god. There is only one way to prove it is nothing more than a beast! Extra: Local zealot pagans may aid the beast.
5.	Feared sorcery & minions
A sorceress has gained new dark magics and is using them to threaten local leaders and gain wealth and power. She has strengthened her warriors and seeks worship from all.
6.	A witch who serves locals is nearby.
A witch uses her good magic to help others, but may be the one causing the sickness or curse that they need help with. She can not be persuaded to turn from her ways. She is always at the periphery of demonic forces, especially impatience and anger. She has tricked or convinced a few ruffians to protect her with her magic & drugs.
7.	Feared natural tree or grove. Pagan protected.
Pagans have long used this spot or natural idol to worship and sacrifice. A local tribe has warriors guard it and priests who tend it and receive worshipers. They will have black magics that empower their presence with fear and force.
8.	Pagan cultist encampment, shaman & chief
A powerful tribe has a rich history of pagan activities. They will have several shamans of young and old, warriors and beasts amongst them. They send out marauding groups to enrich themselves off weaker tribes and passersby. They use their rituals to build up a frenzy and take alchemical potent drugs.
9.	A coven of witches terrorizes the area
A powerful coven of witches reside in a remote area. They have control of the tribe and warriors to do their bidding. They require much sacrifice as they give the warriors special powers and abilities through alchemy and sorcery. The warriors appear and fight like beasts!
10.	Cultist temple erected, followers gathering
A sorcerer of great success and power has built or is building a greater altar and temple to a dark god. He will have great warriors and much wealth, probably due to raids and tribal worship. The temple will be large, elaborate and something of a ziggurat with many rooms and a large temple area with a great idol and sacrificial area.
11.	Ancient site of horrifying rituals, haunted!?
A dead site, filled with cursed and demonic forces, this area will not have man but will have evil present. Traps, tombs, feral creatures and evil spirits will haunt the area. It must be cleansed!
12.	Demon or powerful beast is haunting & corrupting the land. Roll D8 + 4 for support network. If result of 12, add some powers to it or its lair or presence.
Too afraid to give an example. Just kidding. A demon will be possessing a beast or pagan. The demon will have given the possessed supernatural powers beyond just black magic. They will have horns, red eyes, powerful claws or any other physical feature that makes them look and fight demonically.
Larger beasts such as giant boars, bears, wolves can take on these malformed demonic monstrosities. Dragons will also be possessed, making them seem fantastical, intelligent and having magical powers. Humans that have succumbed to this could become larger, bear horns or demonic features and other frightful appearances.
The more intelligent ‘human’ versions should be considered bosses or leaders who are discovered & encountered at the end of a campaign or series of missions. They will have influenced pagan tribes throughout the land and can only be thwarted after dealing, in a progressive storyline, with their many cabals and followers. These are used to overthrow local leadership or churches and spread the cult.
 
	PowerofEVIL	
Magicians and Witches are the source of pagan evil that drives unbelievers. They may be the leader or advisor to a ruler. They will lead any rituals and call forth demonic powers to do their bidding. They will be the source or at the source of whatever pagan plot is unfolding.
There are several classification of the black magic that men use. The sorcerer, warlock and magician are the most common. Astrologer, shaman, diviner and other titles can also be used. There are plenty of crossover but also some distinctions that can be delineated. Each caster can learn other fields while yet refining and expanding their preferred form of devilry.
The aspect of making a deal with the devil did not come into play until the medieval ages around the 14th century. A dark time where the word ‘witch’ and making deals with the devil are noted.
For the purposes of this setting, most are affiliated with Roman/Greek, Norse gods and spirits. As the Bible states, all idols and godly worship are either demonically influenced or one’s imagination.
Some basic concepts concerning pagan caster titles that this setting suggests is that sorcerers are more into power and pain, necromancers deal with the dead, and possession of objects or corpses by evil spirits, warlocks tend to use their powers to support conquest and war, shamans are local pagan clerics who advise and empower a tribe and its leaders, diviners, fortune tellers & astrologers use things in creation as rituals and symbolism to give others future tellings based on their interpretations, magicians can be a general term but also one who focuses on leaders and courtly matters in civil areas. These tend to have a good social standing and are advisors our sought out by many in the court. They could be viewed as charlatans or dilettantes, but others think magicians will give them the foreknowledge or advice to succeed in wealth, power, fame and lust.
Magic Points
They require the average of Spirit & Intellect or Society for Magic Points to perform their magic. The average of these two rounded down gives one their total magic points. The two traits reveal how they must perform and utilize such dark arts.
Whereas Christians rely solely on the Word through the Spirit trait, albeit some utilize relics, it is more an encouragement or focus than necessity, pagans rely on creation and not the Creator, so their magic requires preparation, rituals, pageantry, performance, potions and other physical things.
Is magic real in this game? Do we believe in the power of demonic influence? Yes. However the power of persuasion, drugs, seduction, addictions and so forth make pagans susceptible to worldly passions. The vile ways and demonic possession of blind anger, frothing rage, uncontrollable urges, reprobate minds and all sorts of self destructive behaviors might make them more powerful or magical but it also enslaves them to their vile madness.
The actual possession and control by demons is possible but should be rare and utilized as the climatic finale.
If witches can drug or seduce minions to do their will that would be easier than summoning evil spirits to control. But in the end, they can’t help themselves, they will inevitably resort to demonic control; for their fate is sealed.

	CURSES, MALADIES, BLACK MAGIC for combat	
Duration: This factor isn’t necessary for black magic in general. It can end naturally, through prayer or at GM’s discretion.
Fanaticism (damage die)
Gives a minion a DR to their combat damage and denouement roll. Should have duration!
Condemn (fear caster)
Causes fear onto a target, giving them a penalty roll. They can not approach the sorcerer.
Charm and Control
Cast to keep one’s minions riled up or spiteful and gives a penalty to any chance at knowing the Gospel or conversion. Usually done against preaching in a civil situation with deluge. The casting gives them a resistance roll against the preaching roll.
Curse of the Spirit
This gives one a penalty die to any Spirit rolls for resistance. It is a free action against any minion nearby or an action against a clergy to befuddle them for a time.
Harm, Pain, Suffering
This can do d4 damage to a target. It can appear in various forms like dark tendrils of smoke or a puff of poisonous particles or the grip of the caster. A Spirit or Prowess resist is allowed. In essence it drains their vitality.
Hexen - Curse
This curses one to suffer an additional d4 damage die whenever they are harmed. Duress and deluge are needed.
Malady, Foul Conjuring
This gives one an affliction condition that gives a penalty die to any roll due to some form of ailment like poison, disease, panged. It will add to grievous wounds. It is usually in conjunction with a puff of powder or a spit of poison!
Repulse
This rebuke adds a penalty die to any rolls the target may do to harm the caster. It is a free action and may use the Self Pride rule.
Wound Grievously - Curse
One becomes susceptible to +DR wounding for the duration! A resist is allowed!
	Vile rituals	
These are cast as rituals and the caster or followers could have these effects active for an encounter. Any of the black magics above can be done as a ritual. The GM can decide the extent, sacrifices, deluge, duress and deliverance.
These make for challenges: a goal to hinder, a ritual to disrupt, a place to destroy.


Concoctions, Brewing, Alchemy
This creates potions & poisons to be used as an action or right before a fight. Generally they can add a d4 or more to combat, damage, vigor and/or resistance. They make the creature or follower more powerful in some way. This is one of the ways to make bestial forms from God’s creations. The making of these is costly, requiring a cookery of sorts, ingredients gathered and time to cook. A valuable location to find and destroy by the Church!
Dark Vision
Seeing prophecies this can give oneself or a follower a vision. Each die rank rolled can be given to a follower to use on any future skill roll once.
Deranged
This weakens a weak soul, to make them susceptible to coercion and charm, doing the bidding of the caster. It can make the minion turn into a bestial warrior fitted with furs and accouterments. They become the beasts!!!!! Here one can create beastmen aka goblins, dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls and so on.
Demonic Possession & Feral Ferocity
A magic spell requiring much sacrifice and ritual. This gives the target powerful demonic influences. The scope of powers should have a great strength but also a debilitating madness. It can give great prowess and vigor while being susceptible to rebuke. It could be an incredible cunning but fear of holy symbols.
If it is placed upon creatures they are now feral and bloodthirsty. These beasts are usually put to sleep, possessed, then placed somewhere for maximum impact. They awaken or are released to terrorize the local population.
Hexen, Curse
Witches can make their maladies last much longer than just an encounter! This requires severe sacrifices and rituals. Usually it is a specific target. It requires making a deal with the devil or demons. The location will give clues as to the curse and target. Some may not even know they are cursed and consider it bad luck or an ailment. Clergy can use their Spirit to resist, detect or cure but all of this is contingent on the story, the GM’s discretion, the plot and how the curse was created and used. This can be the central plot of a mission!
 
	Magic Attacks	
Christians are not wont to use ‘magic’. There are two ways of looking at these, none involve the nature of God or of a Christian ethos. One way is in the form of trickery and deception, utilizing confounding elements of alchemy to cause advantages & destruction. The other is in the form of asking for demonic powers to change an outcome.
While Christians certainly understand the advantage of strategy and tactical weaponry, most of these, in the Dark Ages, have not yet been studied as such and are a concoction of manipulative and diabolical minds. Their purpose in using these is to overpower their foe with something akin to magic and power.
Most of these can be interpreted as Deliverance, Deluge, Duration, Distance and Duress. They will affect something directly, whether it’s vitality or an affliction. In some cases it’s obvious like fireball, but most others it will probably be a DRR fail that causes a penalty DR whether as an affliction or temporary penalty. Or, simpler, the GM can predetermine a penalty upon failing to resist or avoid it.
An affliction will require serious healing consideration and will be combined with grievous wounds that are fatal past 5DRs. Some could just be temporary ailments that are not fatal.
Pagan casters will use magic points, that can be referred to as black magic points, preparation or prep points. They average their Spirit with another Trait based on their style of sorcery. These points can be upgraded with die ranks.
If a Christian uses magic to help them in these adventures, the pagans will believe the magic over their faith, blessings or salvation in Christ.
	Fumble on a 1!!!	
An interesting rule for magic or elemental attacks is that a roll of 1 on any of the prep points could cause a fumble or mistake. Some are minor and nuanced at the GMs discretion, but others are major, like the fires and destructive ones. The caster can have skills or raw talent to avoid the calamity and continue the magic rolling above a default 12. Sav and Int are the main traits, but some could more about Soc or Awa, at the player’s roleplay and GMs discretion.
Fireball
Many wizards and magicians will have mastered some sort of fire attack, if given this task or utilized to gain favor or power. These could be prepared grenade types or malatov-like, but always done with a magical flourish.
Deliverance: damage
Deluge: Special rule, if a 1 is rolled, burn self or minions, but important characters can try to avoid with Sav/Awa12 as normal, use Fire Damage for potential growth
Distance: malatov, grenade types
Duration: See Fire Damage table
Duress: Only for main characters, using Awa12 to avoid.

Fire damage	
•	Torch or fire of a lit arrow, d4 damage
•	Campfire, d6 damage
•	Oil upon one, inflamed, d8 damage
•	Fiery pyre of fire, d10 damage
Roll damage, half or below it goes down, above half it grows! GM discretion, if highly flammable or drenched.
Smoke
Similar to fire, but having more a temporary disabling penalty. The gas can be temporary penalties like blinding, coughing or produced from fire to be fatal if forced to breathe for too long. Deliverance or duress act the same, requiring a resistance to the effect. Deluge is important for how many and like fireball can include oneself if the deluge rolls a 1.
The caster may have distance prepared as a tossed or flung container.
Poisonous Cloud
See smoke for stats but a failed resistance to this can be a preassigned die rank affliction or due to DRR failed one. This is based on the capabilities and preparation of the witch. Having a certain DR affliction is somewhat safer to implement game-wise than a DRR which could be fatal on a bad resist! Only witches that are considered very deadly should have deadlier preparations.
Blinding Light
An immense and sudden explosion of brilliant light that could be a temporary penalty or an intensely debilitating blindness. Again the scope and knowledge of the preparer determines the intensity. A temporary penalty means there is -DRs but they can still act. A severe blindness should require at least 6 die ranks worth of preparation in whatever result they prepare. This is akin to going beyond 5 DRs for afflictions to be fatal. This is a temporary blindness and is not considered permanent! This one means they can not see at all and have perhaps -12 to every roll or the GM could use random directional dice for any attempt at attacks or movement.
This can have deluge and duress. Distance may help. This can be done on the spot or as a ritual prepared ahead of time. Stocking up a lot of it is not a ‘thing’ in the Dark Ages and most must be used up while ‘fresh’.
Illusion of the gods
This black magic is about swooning followers with miraculous signs. A sorcerer can do it on the spot or prepare the illusion or a combination of preparation to increase many of the factors and utilize encounter magic points for the final execution. This magic can be anything from minor tricks of light, reflections and shadow, to the theatrical release of doves as a sign, to more extravagant showings of projected lights and reflections around idols & statues and the observance of mystical signs. Deliverance and duress are pretty much the same. Deluge will aid in how many it affects, it doesn’t have to equate to a specific number, in so much as a portion of those present, having the result of 12 refer to a very large audience and any number below a fraction of that.
 
Signs of the gods
Similar to Illusions, this is a preparation or immediate usage of encounter magic points to show a spectacle to get others to believe in their paganism. It will require physical trickery, some showmanship and persuasion. It is a con to be sure, but one with skill, acumen and a bit of luck.

Nightmare Attack
This can be a curse or warning that witches would do to scare anyone. The performance is so convincing it would make one have such stress and fear it would cause them nightmares, panic attacks or so forth. It could be to get them to submit or become so distraught as to be useless or helpless.
It could go beyond psychological, mental and into the realm of real black magic, demonic hauntings. And these are Biblical, having such accounts. But to what end witches can utilize this is to be determined by the GM’s game.
Destroy Stone
Akin to an engineer or sapper’s abilities, this wizardry attack can make stone crumble. It is a devised concoction or explosive or otherwise that causes such damage as to make structural stonework collapse. It is generally not for solid natural stone, but man made that can fall if an area were to be structurally compromised. Utilize deliverance as direct damage upon the stone, having duress reduce its armor save, deluge if warranted but if it were structural, one area might be enough to collapse it. Distance if it were devised as some sort of rocket or lobbed grenade.
Blazing Pig
A strange and odd magical effect! But one Samson and medieval folks have used. It could be other local fauna, but the pig is most common. The flame with oil upon a pig can turn into a mobile flaming attack. Deliverance for fire damage, deluge for how intense and large, duration to make it last, duress to control the pig’s direction! Some of this could be preparation for the day, whilst the final is during the encounter. Like many rituals here, combining for the day and encounter prep points should be possible.
This is literally an engineering feat of war!
Oil, Tar & Fire
Using more controlled elements, fire can be placed as a wall, a line and be long burning. It also has more intense chance for longer lasting fire. It starts as an oil and is generally static or stuck to where placed. Any roll of a 1 on any prep die used could be dangerous! Just as fireball! However the preparer may not light it (rolling final die) or may roll their fire safety skill Sav/Int12 to avoid catching on fire. They may have gotten the oil on themselves!
Magic Tricks
Definitely illusions, these prestidigitation type magic could be as innocent as entertainment or as dodgy as thievery, skulduggery or as part of the rituals and illusions to affect worshipers!
Piercing Cry
A witch’s banshee wail, these are used in rituals and intense situations for several reasons: one, to boost the deadly morale of her followers, two, to unnerve those resistant to her charms, and three, to affect those in battle against her will. There may be horns, instruments or other things that aid in such a strong shrill scream.
Booming Voice
As the witch’s wail but generally for sorcerers, the men who are really in charge even as the pagans claim no genders and that God did not make us male and female! These men have spent countless hours working on such deep booming actor voices, to affect their own or to rebuke the followers of Christ. Expect this voice to have an affect, however temporary, to possibly change the course of evangelism or battle! Use this to boost the morale of his followers, give bonus die to them or to unnerve his enemies.
Overview of Limitless Magic	
As much as magic spells have been described here, consider these examples. All magic spells are all basically a resist, roll off or DRR type effect. One need only think of what that oppressor, that witch or sorcerer has as trappings, as an agenda, as to what is their environment or what sort of lair and cult they have created. What would they have access to -- to then use as a magic, a weapon.
In this, one can devise any type of magic attack they deem, that utilizes Deluge, Duress, Deliverance and if needed Duration and Distance. These generally will drain vitality or give affliction DR penalties in some way. Some are damaging and more physical as fire or poison, but many are more penalties that are temporary and their duration situational.
Some are to give much zeal and rabidness to their followers. Some are meant to frighten any dissidents. Some are actual elemental, chemical attacks to destroy enemies. In most cases, pageantry and a front of showmanship are used, to make the effect, the attack, that much more convincing.

A sorcerer is pulling the strings of any pagan activity. They will be well guarded by beastmen, barbarians or feral beasts ready to be unleashed. These could also be fed concoctions to give them more ferocity in some way.
Conversion: Sorcerers have sunk into the pits of evil, seeking influence and power. They must be stopped in order for conversion to occur for others. Only a miracle from the Lord could save these souls.

Shamans can range from local healers to chieftain advisors. Initially they will have some helpful ‘white’ magic that influences locals to give them more influence and power.
If a shaman uses Intellect, they may be more academic or a naturalist, like an herbalist or alchemist making concoctions to rule or manipulate others.
If they use their Society trait they will probably have a more advisory or leadership rule, using intimidation or social performance to control those around them.
Conversion: Shamans have sunk into the pits of evil, seeking influence and power. They must be stopped in order for conversion to occur for others. Only a miracle from the Lord could save these souls.

magician (malefici), enchanter (incantantores) and conjurors (immissores) inflicting personal injury, invoking demons, summoning dead to harm foes, divination
potions for love, manipulation, strength & power, pagan temples & shrines
A fun and adventurous element that adds a fantasy flavor to the game is adding demonic and concoctive changes to warriors to make them more monstrous. There is some truth to this historically, especially in the vein of rabid or steroid-like and getting warriors to feel animalistic and fearless. This table provides some possibilities to add that extra level of challenge and scare. Remember, these are foul and given ritualistically! No Christian would partake!
