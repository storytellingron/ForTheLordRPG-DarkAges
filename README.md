# ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges
Dark Ages rulebook and setting.

# Methodology: How This Rulebook Works

> **Rules Authority & Interpretation**
>
> This game assumes careful reading and restrained interpretation.
> If a bonus, Die Rank, upgrade, or exception is not explicitly stated, it does not exist.
> Do not infer balance, symmetry, or hidden modifiers.
> Traits, written DRs, and listed equipment are the only sources of mechanical effect. Every skill has an appropriate trait modifier.
> When unsure, favor simplicity and the written rule over intuition.
>
> 
> **Using AI for Rules Questions**
>
> When asking an AI about these rules, ask it to:
> - Cite the relevant section
> - Avoid assuming unstated upgrades
> - Prefer Traits and written bonuses over inferred balance


## Workflow
1. **Write in GitHub**  
   - All rules live in `index.md` inside this repo.  
   - Only the repo owner can edit (no outside changes).  

2. **Two Links Are Created**
   - **GitHub Pages link** → formatted rulebook for humans:  
     `https://storytellingron.github.io/ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges/`  
   - **Raw file link** → plain text for AI parsing:  
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storytellingron/ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges/main/index.md`  

3. **Sharing**
   - Players and GMs use the Pages link to read the rules.  
   - AIs use the raw link to parse the rules directly. Always repost the link when asking the AI to do something. It will not check the latest by itself.  

4. **Editing**
   - Only the repo owner can update the files.  
   - Every edit automatically updates both links.  

## Why This Matters
- **Locked down editing**: only the creator can change the rules.  
- **Open access**: anyone can read or parse the rules.
- **AI‑friendly**: the raw link ensures clean text for Copilot or other assistants.
