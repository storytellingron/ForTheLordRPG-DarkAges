# ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges
Dark Ages rulebook and setting.

# Methodology: How This Rulebook Works

## Workflow
1. **Write in GitHub**  
   - All rules live in `index.md` inside this repo.  
   - Only the repo owner can edit (no outside changes).  

2. **Two Links Are Created**
   - **GitHub Pages link** → formatted rulebook for humans:  
     `https://storytellingron.github.io/ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges/`  
   - **Raw file link** → plain text for AI parsing:  
     `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/storytellingron/ForTheLordRPG-DarkAges/main/index.md`  

3. **Sharing**
   - Players and GMs use the Pages link to read the rules.  
   - AIs use the raw link to parse the rules directly. Always repost the link when asking the AI to do something. It will not check the latest by itself.  

4. **Editing**
   - Only the repo owner can update the files.  
   - Every edit automatically updates both links.  

## Why This Matters
- **Locked down editing**: only the creator can change the rules.  
- **Open access**: anyone can read or parse the rules.
- **AI‑friendly**: the raw link ensures clean text for Copilot or other assistants.
