## Dice System

### Stealth Success
### Example: Brother Thomas Attempts Stealth

Brother Thomas, a Scout, tries to sneak past pagan guards at night.

- Trait: Awareness +3
- Total Die Ranks (DR): 7 (from Stealth skill, gear, and situational bonuses)

**Step 1: Build the Dice Pool**
- 7 DR converts to {d12, d6}.
- Roll both dice and keep the highest.

**Step 2: Make the Roll**
- Roll d20 → 11
- Add Trait (+3) → 14
- Roll Dice Pool {d12=9, d6=4} → keep highest = 9
- Total = 14 + 9 = 23

**Step 3: Compare to Difficulty**
- Standard Difficulty = 12
- 23 vs 12 → Success

**Step 4: Calculate Die Rank Result (DRR)**
- (23 − 12) ÷ 2 = 5 DRR

**GM Narrative Payoff**
The GM rules that Brother Thomas’s success grants a **+5 DRR bonus** to the *next related action*.  
- If Thomas launches a surprise attack, he adds +5 DRR to that strike.  
- If another missionary sneaks immediately after him, they gain +5 DRR to their stealth roll.  
- The bonus applies only in this moment, not stored for later.
