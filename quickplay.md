# Simple Core Rules (Quick Play Version)

This simple version provides everything needed to start playing immediately.  
No dice pools, no advanced wound rules, and no DRR. Just fast, clear gameplay.

---

# Purpose of Play

- You play **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** in the Dark Ages.  
- The goal is **evangelism, discipleship, fellowship, and planting churches**, not becoming fantasy heroes.  
- Adventures blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

---

# Gameplay Loop

1. The GM presents missions, encounters, challenges, and NPCs.
2. Players roleplay missionaries using Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.
3. Challenges are resolved with the **Die System**.
4. Success results in conversions, helping communities, or planting churches.
5. Glory Points allow characters to grow in Traits, skills, armor fitting, and blessings.
6. Salvage and treasure may be used to support missions or given to the Church.
7. Growth of the Church can support and give missions.

---

# Dice System (Simple Version)

Most actions use:

**d20 + Trait + DR**

The **Trait** represents the character’s natural ability.  
The **DR** represents dice bonuses from skills, tools, equipment, blessings, or situational advantages.

---

## Die Ranks (DR)

In the simple version, characters roll **one DR die**:

- **1 DR → d4**
- **2 DR → d6**
- **3 DR → d8**
- **4 DR → d10**
- **5 DR → d12** (maximum for simple play)

You will almost always roll only one DR die.

**Where DR comes from:**

- Relevant skill  
- Helpful gear  
- Blessings or inspiration  
- Tactical advantages  
- Assistance from one ally, +1DR  

---

## Making a Roll

To attempt an action:

1. Roll **1d20**.
2. Add your relevant **Trait**.
3. Roll your **single DR die** and add the result.
4. Compare your total to the **Difficulty**.

### Difficulty
- Standard Difficulty: **12**
- Harder or easier tasks adjust at GM discretion.
- Hitting someone uses their Defense as the difficulty.
- **Treacherous Terrain** The GM can roll one's Armor Save and add it to 12 if the situation calls for it.
- **Opposed Rolls** Two characters roll; the **higher total wins**.
