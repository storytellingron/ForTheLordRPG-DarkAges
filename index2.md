# Core Rules

## Purpose
- Players are missionaries, saints, or evangelists — not divine beings.
- Focus: evangelism, fellowship, planting churches.
- Campaigns mix medieval history, folklore, and spiritual storytelling.

## Gameplay Loop
1. GM sets missions, maps, NPCs, encounters.
2. Players roleplay missionaries with Traits, skills, gear, blessings.
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success = conversions, church planting.
4. Rewards: Glory Points, gear upgrades, skill improvements.

## Dice System
- Main die: **d20** for all rolls.
- Add Trait bonus + Dice Pool vs Difficulty.
- Default Difficulty = 12.
- **Die Ranks (DRs)**: 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8, 4=d10, 5=d12.
- Dice Pool: every 5 DRs = d12; remainder = smaller die.
- Roll = d20 + Trait + Dice Pool → must equal or exceed Difficulty.

## Difficulty & Maneuvers
- Default Difficulty = 12.
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage after a hit.
- Treacherous terrain: Difficulty = 12 + Armor Save.
- Extreme terrain: add situational DRs (storm, darkness, arrows, etc.).

## Die Rank Results (DRR)
- Success: roll – difficulty, halved = DRR bonus.
- Failure: difference halved = DR penalty.
- DRRs can be applied to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties.

## Combat
- Surprise/Ambush: Awareness roll‑off.
- Order: crossbows → ranged → spears → light weapons → heavy weapons.
- Turn: one maneuver + one action (or two maneuvers).
- Actions: melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- Free actions: speech, drawing weapons, blessings.

## Damage & Healing
- Weapons: d4–d12 depending on size/type.
- Vitality (PCs) / Vigor (NPCs) reduced by damage.
- Armor Save: roll to reduce damage; sacrifice item to absorb grievous wound.
- Short rest: recover Prowess/Spirit + d4.
- Full rest: recover all vitality.

## Criticals & Fumbles
- **Nat20**: automatic success, double damage, grievous wound rules.
- **Nat1**: fumble table (hit ally, stumble, damage gear, etc.).
- Avoiding fumbles: high DR bonuses reduce chance.

## Grappling
- Awareness to escape.
- Roll off with weapon/grappling skills.
- Winner applies DR penalties or vitality drain.

## Special Rules
- Point Blank: melee range surprise, auto‑hit except Nat1.
- Fire damage: torch d4, campfire d6, oil d8, pyre d10.

# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.
- Success = establishing a church; then GM introduces the next mission.
- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.

- **Failure**: 1DR damage + possible grievous wound after armor save.

## Altars, Shrines, Tombs
- Fires: pagan sacrifices, distractions, or rituals.
