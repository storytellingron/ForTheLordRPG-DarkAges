# Core Mechanics

## Purpose
- Player characters are **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** — not divine beings.
- The focus of the game is **evangelism, fellowship, discipleship, and church planting**.
- Campaigns blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay Loop
1. The GM prepares missions, encounters, maps, and NPCs.  
2. Players roleplay missionaries and gain bonuses from Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.  
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success often results in conversions or establishing churches.  
4. Rewards: Gain **Glory Points** to improve Traits, skills, gear, and armor.  
5. Salvage: Treasures found during missions may be used for gear and supplies, with excess given back to the Church.

# Dice System
Most actions are resolved by rolling a **d20**, applying your **Trait**, and adding the result of your **Dice Pool** (generated by Die Ranks).

To resolve an action, roll:

**`d20 + Trait + highest die from your Dice Pool`**

## Die Ranks (DR) & The Dice Pool
Characters gain **Die Ranks (DR)** from skills, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and situational advantages.

DR does **not** add directly to a roll. Instead:

> **DR creates a Dice Pool**, which the acting player rolls alongside the d20.

This mirrors the biblical idea of **casting lots** — gathering every available resource before entrusting the outcome to God.  
*Author’s Note: Success is not required; God’s will prevails regardless.*

## Converting DR Into a Dice Pool
1. Add all DR relevant to the roll.  
2. For every **5 DR**, add **one d12** to the Dice Pool.  
3. If DR remains (1–4), add **one die** based on the remainder:
- **1 DR → +d4**  
- **2 DR → +d6**  
- **3 DR → +d8**  
- **4 DR → +d10**

Dice Pools are written as:

**`{d12, d8}kh`** → roll all dice in the braces; *keep highest* (with the 7+ rule below).

## Rolling the Dice
To make a check:
1. Roll **1d20**.  
2. Roll **all** dice in the Dice Pool.  
3. Identify the **highest die** in the pool.  
4. Add together:  
   - d20 result  
   - relevant Trait bonus or penalty  
   - the highest Dice Pool die  
   - any additional 7+ results  
5. Compare the final total to the Difficulty.

## The 7+ Rule
Any die in the Dice Pool that rolls **7 or higher** applies:
- Negates a Nat1 fumble result from the d20.
- Adds to the total, even if not the highest result.

## Summary of Dice System
- **DR above 5 creates a Dice Pool**  
- **Every 5 DR → d12**  
- **Remainder DR → d4, d6, d8 or d10**  
- **Skill Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ results add to the total and negate natural 1s**

## Difficulty
- Default Difficulty: **12**  
- Meet or exceed the Difficulty to succeed.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Opposed checks:** both sides roll; higher total wins.  
- **Treacherous terrain:** GM rolls the character’s **Armor Save** to add to the Difficulty. This gives the sense of the armor's burden. Only apply the basic Armor Save versus if the character upgraded it with Glory Points. 
- **Extreme conditions:** GM may combine situational DRs (darkness, wet, mud, storm, under attack, etc...) to the **Armor Save** DR, then rolling.

## Die Rank Results (DRR) — Optional Rule
- On success: (Total − Difficulty) ÷ 2 = **DRR bonus**.  
- On failure: (Difficulty − Total) ÷ 2 = **DRR penalty**.  
- DRR may be applied immediately to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties.  
- GM discretion and situational use are encouraged.

## Combat
- **Surprise / Ambush:** Opponents make an Awareness roll-off. Use highest Awareness from each group. Winners may get first free attack.
- **Faith Points** are rolled now, to be used for this encounter.  
- **Initiative Order:** loaded crossbows → ranged → spears → claws → light weapons → heavy weapons. May do an Awareness roll-off if similar. GM may use discretion.  
- **Turn Structure:** one **maneuver** + one **action**, or two maneuvers.  
- **Actions include:** melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- **Manuevers include:** reloading, moving, using the special rule for DRR action rolls like dodge or parry.
- **Free Actions:** speech, drawing weapons, invoking a helpful blessing.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** that adversely affect a target are in the ranged initiative order.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** of any sort, may only be used once per turn.

## Damage & Healing
- **Weapons** deal damage from **d4 to d12**, depending on size and type.  
- **Vitality (PCs)** and **Vigor (NPCs)** decrease when damage is taken. Think of these as exhaustion, cuts & bruise, but not grievous wounds.
  
After taking damage:

- **Armor Save:** roll armor to reduce incoming damage; armor or gear may be sacrificed to absorb grievous wounds.
- A character or monster at **0 Vitality or Less** cannot act normally until stabilized.

- **Short Rest:** recover **Prowess or Spirit + d4**.  
- **Full Rest:** restore all Vitality.

## Criticals & Fumbles

- **Nat20:** automatic success, **double damage**, and **Grievous Wounds rule** applies.  
- **Nat1:** consult the fumble table (e.g., strike an ally, stumble, drop or damage gear).  
- **Avoiding Fumbles:** higher DR values help reduce the likelihood of suffering a catastrophic outcome, the 7+ Rule.

## Grievous Wounds

A **Grievous Wound** represents severe bodily harm. These wounds occur when:

- A character is struck by a **Nat20** attack in combat, or  
- A situation involves extreme failure or massive harm (GM discretion).

### Grievous Wound Calculation (Nat20 Attacks)

1. Roll **double weapon damage**.  
2. Apply the target’s **Armor Save** to reduce the damage.  
3. Any damage that gets through:
   - Reduces **Vitality/Vigor** as normal, and  
   - Is used to determine the wound’s severity:  
     **Half of the damage taken = the Grievous Wound’s DR penalty.**

This DR penalty represents the wound’s seriousness.

### Shifting the Wound to Armor

After determining the wound’s DR penalty, the target may:

- Move some or all of the **wound DR** onto their **armor’s DR** instead.
- This reduces the armor by that many DRs.
- If doing so reduces armor to **0 DR**, the armor is **destroyed**.
- A character may also **sacrifice a shield or great helm** to completely cancel the Grievous Wound from that attack.

### Effects of Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds impose a **DR penalty** that affects:

- Life Save rolls when at 0 Vitality
- Penalties to one roll per turn. The GM picks one, rolls the Grievous Wound DR and adds it to the difficulty of that roll. He can choose other options, but only one per turn against the grievously wounded. He may forget or forgo it. The player never has to deal with the penalty in determining their own rolls.

These wounds persist until treated through appropriate care, skills, or blessings. Healing such are noted in the skills, Miracle of Healing and DRR rules.

### Afflictions

Poison, disease, and similar conditions are treated as **Grievous Wounds**.  
If an Affliction’s DR penalty becomes **worse than −5 DR**, it is **fatal**.

Stun, fear and other temporary penalties are not part of the fatal condition but will still add to the DR penalty.

Afflictions are gained from:

- Failing disease or poison rolls.  
- Prolonged exposure to harsh environments.  
- Curses or spiritual attacks (GM discretion).  
- Failing specific encounter hazards.

**Recovery:**  
Afflictions can be removed through:

- Time and rest,  
- Medical care,  
- Herbal treatments,  
- Prayer or blessings,  
- Completing certain quests.

The GM determines the steps and difficulty of recovery.

## Healing Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds require intentional healing. They do not recover through normal Vitality rest.

The Difficulty to heal a Grievous Wound is:

**Difficulty = 12 + Grievous Wound DR**

A healing attempt produces a **DRR**. Any DR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.

---

## Miracle of Healing (Blessing)

The Nun or Blessed character acts **first** because her miracle is the safest method.

For the Miracle of Healing:

- The nun adds **Faith Points as DRs** directly into her Dice Pool.  
- She may add **any of her own healing-related skills** (Healing, Surgery, Mothering, Herbalism, etc.) as additional DRs.  
- She rolls **Spirit + {Dice Pool}kh** against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- Any DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- **Failure never worsens the wound.**  
- May be used **once per day**.

This represents divine aid working through her skills and devotion.

---

## Healing Through Skills (Healer or Surgeon)

After the Nun’s attempt (if any), a healer may treat the wound:

- Add **Trait + Healing/Surgery skills** and any situational DRs.  
- Roll against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- A disastrous failure may worsen the wound.

May be attempted **once per day**.

---

## Rest Healing (Nightly Required Roll)

Every full night of rest, the wounded character must roll:

**Prowess or Spirit + {any chosen DRs}kh vs (12 + Wound DR)**

### The Pain Rule (Special)

If the patient chooses to add **any** of their own DRs  
(e.g., Medical knowledge, Blessings, Inspired Die, Hope DR, etc.):

- The GM must roll the **Wound DR as a penalty die** (representing pain, trembling, shock).  
- The result of this penalty die is **added to the Difficulty** for that night.

This makes self-healing risky but potentially rewarding.

A DRR above the final Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
Failure or very low DRR may worsen the wound (GM discretion).

The Rest Healing roll is **mandatory** until the wound is fully healed.

---

## Order of Healing (Per Day)

1. **Miracle of Healing** (Nun / Blessed)  
2. **Healer or Surgeon**  
3. **Nightly Rest Healing** (required)

Each step may reduce the wound’s DR through DRR.

---

## Resolving Complete Healing

When the Wound DR reaches **0**, the Grievous Wound is healed.

Vitality may then recover normally.
