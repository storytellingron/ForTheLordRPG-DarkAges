# Core Mechanics

## Purpose
- Player characters are **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** — not divine beings.
- The focus of the game is **evangelism, fellowship, discipleship, and church planting**.
- Campaigns blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay
1. The Grande Minister or GM prepares missions, encounters, maps, and NPCs.  
2. Players roleplay missionaries and gain bonuses from Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.  
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success often results in conversions or establishing churches.
4. Roleplaying involves investigation, inquiry, conversions, reconciliations and more! It isn't just about heroics and gaining rewards, but about the mindset of evangelism & planting churches to change the World.
5. Rewards: Gain **Glory Points** to improve Traits, skills, gear, and armor.  
6. Salvage: Treasures found during missions may be used for gear and supplies, with excess given back to the Church.

## Dice System

Most rolls in the game are resolved by rolling a **d20**, applying your **Trait** bonus or penalty, and adding the die of the **Die Ranks**.

To resolve a roll versus a difficulty:

**`d20 + Trait + DR Die`**

The **Die** comes from your **Die Ranks (DRs)** (see below).

### Die Ranks (DR)

DRs represent upgraded die with a skill, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and situational advantages.  
For the simplest version of the game:

- **1 DR → d4**  
- **2 DR → d6**  
- **3 DR → d8**  
- **4 DR → d10**  
- **5 DR → d12**

### Simple Game
In the simple game, characters should be limited to **5 DR**, so a single bonus die for any rolls. This caps any bonuses from skill, gear, blessings, situational bonuses. This helps simplify the game for both GMs and players. The GM should accordingly, keep NPCs and encounters at relatively low stats, especially armor saves! Start with easier challenges, i.e. poor bandits, feral vermin.

### The Dice Pool (Advanced)
Incorporating the advanced version should come after players and GMs understand the basic rolls for combat & encounters, how to use blessings and how to advance their character's skills and armor with Glory Points.
- **Explanation:** This solves the common RPG issue of advanced characters becoming too powerful as they upgrade. As one gains more and more DRs, their bonus gets more diffused and costly. Yet there is still some advancement. And new players can join a long campaign and still contribute.

Once a character accumulates more than 5 DR from skills, equipment, blessings, etc., these DRs form a **Dice Pool** of multiple dice:

1. For every **5 DR**, add one **d12** to the pool.  
2. If any DR remains (1–4), add one die based on the remainder:
   - **1 DR → d4**
   - **2 DR → d6**
   - **3 DR → d8**
   - **4 DR → d10**

Dice Pools are written like this:

**`{d12, d8}kh`** → roll all dice in the braces; **keep highest** (with special 7+ rule).

The acting player rolls all dice in their pool, but only the highest result gets added to the d20 total, unless modified by 7+ results (see below).

## Rolling the Dice

To make a check:

1. Roll **d20**.  
2. Roll your DR die or full Dice Pool.  
3. Identify the **single highest** die result.  
4. Add together:
   - d20 result  
   - Trait bonus or penalty  
   - Highest DR / Dice Pool result  
   - Any additional 7+ results  
5. Compare the total to the Difficulty.

## The 7+ Rule

Any die rolled in the Dice Pool that shows **7 or higher**:

- **Negates a natural 1** (fumble) on the d20.  
- **Adds to the total**, even if it is *not* the highest die in the dice pool.

## Summary of Dice System

-  **d20** plus a specific **Trait** bonus/penalty.
- **1–5 DR**: Basic single DR die (d4–d12).  
- **6+ DR**: Advanced **Dice Pool**.  
  - **Every 5 DR → d12**  
  - **Remainder DR → d4 / d6 / d8 / d10**  
- **Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ dice** also add to the total and negate Nat1.


## Difficulty
- Default Difficulty: **12**  
- Meet or exceed the Difficulty to succeed.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Opposed checks:** both sides roll; higher total wins.  
- **Treacherous terrain:** GM rolls the character’s **Armor Save** to add to the Difficulty. This gives the sense of the armor's burden. Only apply the basic Armor Save versus if the character upgraded it with Glory Points. 
- **Extreme conditions:** GM may combine situational DRs (darkness, wet, mud, storm, under attack, etc...) to the **Armor Save** DR, then rolling. For easy play, no more than 5DRs total.
- **Explanation:** This gives both GM and players an easy way to understand the situation and lets the dice decide how hard it is.

## Die Rank Results (DRR) — (Advanced)
- On success: (Total − Difficulty) ÷ 2 = **DRR bonus**.  
- On failure: (Difficulty − Total) ÷ 2 = **DRR penalty**.  
- DRR may be applied immediately to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties like damage or gear wear.  
- **Explanation:** GM can ignore this or use to help define the results of a roll.

## Combat
- **Surprise / Ambush:** Opponents make an Awareness roll-off. Use highest Awareness from each group. Winners may get first free attack. The GM may give the highest Armor Save DRs of each group, as a bonus, to the other group!
- **Faith Points** are rolled now, to be used for this encounter.  
- **Initiative Order:** loaded crossbows → ranged → spears → claws → light weapons → heavy weapons. May do an Awareness roll-off if similar. GM may use discretion.  
- **Turn Structure:** one **maneuver** + one **action**, or two maneuvers.  
- **Actions include:** melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- **Manuevers include:** reloading, moving, using the special rule for DRR action rolls like dodge or parry.
- **Free Actions:** speech, drawing weapons, invoking a helpful blessing.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** that adversely affect a target are in the ranged initiative order.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** of any sort, may only be used once per turn.

## Damage & Healing
- **Weapons** deal damage from **d4 to d12**, depending on size and type. In advanced play, these may go beyond 5DRs due to gear or skill upgrades. 
- **Vitality (PCs)** and **Vigor (NPCs)** decrease when damage is taken. Think of these as exhaustion, cuts & bruise, but not grievous wounds.
- **0 Or Less** At 0, one is out, utterly exhausted, but stable. At a negative, the **Life Saves** rules are used. One could fade from this world! For NPCs, 0 or less, the GM can decide if they are utterly exhausted, deceased or able to be healed and does not need to use exact rules.
  
After taking damage:

- **Armor Save:** roll armor to reduce incoming damage; armor or gear may be sacrificed to absorb grievous wounds.
- A character or monster at **0 Vitality or Less** cannot act normally until stabilized.

- **Short Rest:** recover **Prowess or Spirit + d4**.  
- **Full Rest:** restore all Vitality.

## Criticals & Fumbles

- **Nat20:** automatic success, **double damage**, and **Grievous Wounds rule** applies.  
- **Nat1:** consult the fumble table (e.g., strike an ally, stumble, drop or damage gear).  
- **Avoiding Fumbles:** higher DR values help reduce the likelihood of suffering a catastrophic outcome, the 7+ Rule.

## Life Saves & Conditions

When a character’s **Vitality is 0 or less**, they must make **Life Saves** each turn until stabilized or dead.

**Life Save Roll:**  
`d20 + Prowess or Spirit`  
**Difficulty:** 12
- + Grievous Wound DR if Advanced play.

- **Success:** Recover **+d4 Vitality**.  
- **Failure:** Lose **−d6 Vitality**.

A character dies when their Vitality reaches the **negative of their maximum Vitality**.

Life Saves continue each turn until the character stabilizes, recovers above 0 Vitality, or dies.

This represents the struggle to stay alive in the face of grievous injury or shock — requiring both physical resolve and spiritual fortitude.

## Grievous Wounds (Advanced)

A **Grievous Wound** represents severe bodily harm. These wounds occur when:

- A character is struck by a **Nat20** attack in combat, or  
- A situation involves extreme failure or massive harm (GM discretion).

### Grievous Wound Calculation (Nat20 Attacks)

1. Roll **double weapon damage**.  
2. Apply the target’s **Armor Save** to reduce the damage.  
3. Any damage that gets through:
   - Reduces **Vitality/Vigor** as normal, and  
   - Is used to determine the wound’s severity:  
     **Half of the damage taken = the Grievous Wound’s DR penalty.**

This DR penalty represents the wound’s seriousness.

### Shifting the Wound to Armor

After determining the wound’s DR penalty, the target may:

- Move some or all of the **wound DR** onto their **armor’s DR** instead.
- This reduces the armor by that many DRs.
- If doing so reduces armor to **0 DR**, the armor is **destroyed**.
- A character may also **sacrifice a shield or great helm** to completely cancel the Grievous Wound from that attack.

### Effects of Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds impose a **DR penalty** that affects:

- Life Save rolls when at 0 Vitality
- Penalties to one roll per turn. The GM picks one, rolls the Grievous Wound DR and adds it to the difficulty of that roll. He can choose other options, but only one per turn against the grievously wounded. He may forget or forgo it. The player never has to deal with the penalty in determining their own rolls.

These wounds persist until treated through appropriate care, skills, or blessings. Healing such are noted in the skills, Miracle of Healing and DRR rules.

### Afflictions

Poison, disease, and similar conditions are treated as **Grievous Wounds**.  
If an Affliction’s DR penalty becomes **worse than −5 DR**, it is **fatal**.

Stun, fear and other temporary penalties are not part of the fatal condition but will still add to the DR penalty.

Afflictions are gained from:

- Failing disease or poison rolls.  
- Prolonged exposure to harsh environments.  
- Curses or spiritual attacks (GM discretion).  
- Failing specific encounter hazards.

**Recovery:**  
Afflictions can be removed through:

- Time and rest,  
- Medical care,  
- Herbal treatments,  
- Prayer or blessings,  
- Completing certain quests.

The GM determines the steps and difficulty of recovery.

## Healing Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds require intentional healing. They do not recover through normal Vitality rest.

The Difficulty to heal a Grievous Wound is:

**Difficulty = 12 + Grievous Wound DR**

A healing attempt produces a **DRR**. Any DR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.

---

## Miracle of Healing (Blessing)

The Nun or Blessed character acts **first** because her miracle is the safest method.

For the Miracle of Healing:

- The nun adds **Faith Points as DRs** directly into her Dice Pool.  
- She may add **any of her own healing-related skills** (Healing, Surgery, Mothering, Herbalism, etc.) as additional DRs.  
- She rolls **Spirit + {Dice Pool}kh** against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- Any DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- **Failure never worsens the wound.**  
- May be used **once per day**.

This represents divine aid working through her skills and devotion.

---

## Healing Through Skills (Healer or Surgeon)

After the Nun’s attempt (if any), a healer may treat the wound:

- Add **Trait + Healing/Surgery skills** and any situational DRs.  
- Roll against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- A disastrous failure may worsen the wound.

May be attempted **once per day**.

---

## Rest Healing (Nightly Required Roll)

Every full night of rest, the wounded character must roll:

**Prowess or Spirit + {any chosen DRs}kh vs (12 + Wound DR)**

### The Pain Rule (Special)

If the patient chooses to add **any** of their own DRs  
(e.g., Medical knowledge, Blessings, Inspired Die, Hope DR, etc.):

- The GM must roll the **Wound DR as a penalty die** (representing pain, trembling, shock).  
- The result of this penalty die is **added to the Difficulty** for that night.

This makes self-healing risky but potentially rewarding.

A DRR above the final Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
Failure or very low DRR may worsen the wound (GM discretion).

The Rest Healing roll is **mandatory** until the wound is fully healed.

---

## Order of Healing (Per Day)

1. **Miracle of Healing** (Nun / Blessed)  
2. **Healer or Surgeon**  
3. **Nightly Rest Healing** (required)

Each step may reduce the wound’s DR through DRR.

---

## Resolving Complete Healing

When the Wound DR reaches **0**, the Grievous Wound is healed.

Vitality may then recover normally.
