# Core Rules

## Purpose
- Players are missionaries, saints, or evangelists — not divine beings.
- Focus: evangelism, fellowship, planting churches.
- Campaigns mix medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay Loop
1. GM sets missions, maps, NPCs, encounters.
2. Players roleplay missionaries and have bonuses based on Traits, skills, gear, blessings.
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success = conversions, church planting.
4. Rewards: Gain Glory Points to spend on skill upgrades, trait improvements, better armor fitting and more.
5. Salvage: In Dark Ages, treasures can be found, to spend on gear & supplies, the rest to give to the Church.

## Dice System

To resolve an action, roll a **d20** and add:
- Your relevant **Trait**.
- The **highest die** from your **Dice Pool** roll.


### Die Ranks (DR) & The Dice Pool

Characters gain **Die Ranks (DR)** from skills, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and favorable circumstances.

DR does **not** add directly to a roll. Instead:

> **DR creates a Dice Pool**, which the *acting player* rolls alongside the d20.

This reflects the biblical idea of **casting lots** — gathering all preparation and support before placing the outcome in God's hands. Author's Note: It is not important to succeed at our endeavors for the Lord, no matter our outcome, God's Will will be done.

### Converting DR Into a Dice Pool

1. Add up all DR relevant to the action.  
2. For every **5 DR**, add **one d12** to the Dice Pool.  
3. If DR remains (1–4), add **one die** based on the remainder:

- **1 DR → +d4**  
- **2 DR → +d6**  
- **3 DR → +d8**  
- **4 DR → +d10**

Only the **acting player** rolls all Dice Pool dice.

Rolling looks like this: d20 + 4 + {d12,d8}kh
Character stats: Prowess+4, sword skill+3DR, sword+2DR, Blessing+2DR, high ground+1DR!

### Rolling the Dice

To resolve an action, the acting player rolls:

**`d20 + Trait + Dice Pool`**

- Roll the d20  
- Roll **all** dice in the Dice Pool  
- Identify the **single highest** result in the pool  
- Add that highest result + Trait to the d20  
- Compare the total to the Difficulty

#### The 7+ Rule
Any die in the Dice Pool that rolls **7 or higher** follows two rules:
- Cancels a 1 result from the d20 roll, the fumble roll or the Nat1 roll.
- Adds the die to the total, even if it's not the highest die from the dice pool. So it 'explodes' or stacks, is added to the result.

### Summary

- **DR creates a Dice Pool**  
- **Every 5 DR → +d12**  
- **Remainder DR → +d4 / +d6 / +d8 / +d10**  
- **Only the acting player rolls the entire pool**  
- **Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ rolls also add and negate natural 1s`**

### Difficulty
- The default Difficulty is **12**. Equal or exceed it to succeed.
#### Changes to Difficulty:
- Opposed checks: both sides roll; higher total wins.
- Treacherous Terrain: add the character’s **Armor Save** to the Difficulty when maneuvering in treacherous conditions.
- Extreme terrain: add situational DRs (storm, darkness, arrows, etc.).

### Die Rank Results (DRR) (Optional)
- Optional bonuses for how well one succeeds or fails with further DR affects.
- On success: Total minus difficulty, then halved is a **DRR bonus**.
- On failure: total under diffuclty, then halved is a **DR penalty**.
- These DRs can then be put to immediate use for the next interaction based on the situation.
- DRRs can be applied to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties. Each has slightly different ways of applying it and is noted in its own section. GM discretion and expediency are also valid.

## Combat
- Surprise/Ambush: Awareness roll‑off.
- Order: crossbows → ranged → spears → light weapons → heavy weapons.
- Turn: one maneuver + one action (or two maneuvers).

- Free actions: speech, drawing weapons, blessings.

## Damage & Healing
- Weapons: d4–d12 depending on size/type.
- Vitality (PCs) / Vigor (NPCs) reduced by damage.
- Armor Save: roll to reduce damage; sacrifice item to absorb grievous wound.
- Short rest: recover Prowess/Spirit + d4.
- Full rest: recover all vitality.

## Criticals & Fumbles
- **Nat20**: automatic success, double damage, grievous wound rules.
- **Nat1**: fumble table (hit ally, stumble, damage gear, etc.).
- Avoiding fumbles: high DR bonuses reduce chance.

## Grappling

# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.
- Success = establishing a church; then GM introduces the next mission.
- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.
