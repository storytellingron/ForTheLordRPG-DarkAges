# Core Mechanics

## Purpose
- Player characters are **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** — not divine beings.
- The focus of the game is **evangelism, fellowship, discipleship, and church planting**.
- Campaigns blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay Loop
1. The GM prepares missions, encounters, maps, and NPCs.  
2. Players roleplay missionaries and gain bonuses from Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.  
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success often results in conversions or establishing churches.  
4. Rewards: Gain **Glory Points** to improve Traits, skills, gear, and armor.  
5. Salvage: Treasures found during missions may be used for gear and supplies, with excess given back to the Church.

# Dice System

Most actions are resolved by rolling a **d20**, applying your **Trait**, and adding the result of your **Dice Pool** (generated by Die Ranks).

To resolve an action, roll:

**`d20 + Trait + highest die from your Dice Pool`**

## Die Ranks (DR) & The Dice Pool

Characters gain **Die Ranks (DR)** from skills, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and situational advantages.

DR does **not** add directly to a roll. Instead:

> **DR creates a Dice Pool**, which the acting player rolls alongside the d20.

This mirrors the biblical idea of **casting lots** — gathering every available resource before entrusting the outcome to God.  
*Author’s Note: Success is not required; God’s will prevails regardless.*

## Converting DR Into a Dice Pool

1. Add all DR relevant to the action.  
2. For every **5 DR**, add **one d12** to the Dice Pool.  
3. If DR remains (1–4), add **one die** based on the remainder:

- **1 DR → +d4**  
- **2 DR → +d6**  
- **3 DR → +d8**  
- **4 DR → +d10**

Only the **acting player** rolls all Dice Pool dice.

Dice Pools are written as:

**`{d12, d8}kh`** → roll all dice in the braces; *keep highest* (with the 7+ rule below).

## Rolling the Dice

To make a check:

1. Roll **1d20**.  
2. Roll **all** dice in the Dice Pool.  
3. Identify the **highest die** in the pool.  
4. Add together:  
   - d20 result  
   - relevant Trait  
   - the highest Dice Pool die  
   - any additional 7+ results  
5. Compare the final total to the Difficulty.

## The 7+ Rule

Any die in the Dice Pool that rolls **7 or higher** applies:

### 1. Natural 1 Protection
If the d20 shows a **natural 1**, but *any* Dice Pool die rolled **7+**,  
the natural 1 is **not** an automatic failure. Resolve the roll normally.

### 2. Additional 7+ Dice Add to the Total
If one or more Dice Pool dice roll **7+** and are **not** the highest die:

- Each 7+ result is **also added** to the total.  
- You always add the **highest die**, plus **any additional 7+ results**.

## Summary of Dice System
- **DR creates a Dice Pool**  
- **Every 5 DR → +d12**  
- **Remainder DR → +d4 / +d6 / +d8 / +d10**  
- **Only the acting player rolls the Dice Pool**  
- **Action Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ results add to the total and negate natural 1s**

## Difficulty
- Default Difficulty: **12**  
- Meet or exceed the Difficulty to succeed.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Opposed checks:** both sides roll; higher total wins.  
- **Treacherous terrain:** add the character’s **Armor Save** to the Difficulty.  
- **Extreme conditions:** apply situational DRs (storms, darkness, volleys of arrows, etc.).

## Die Rank Results (DRR) — Optional Rule
- On success: (Total − Difficulty) ÷ 2 = **DRR bonus**.  
- On failure: (Difficulty − Total) ÷ 2 = **DRR penalty**.  
- DRR may be applied immediately to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties.  
- GM discretion and situational use are encouraged.

## Combat

- **Surprise / Ambush:** Opponents make an Awareness roll-off. Winner may get first free attack.  
- **Initiative Order:** loaded crossbows → ranged → spears → claws → light weapons → heavy weapons. May do an Awareness roll-off if similar.  
- **Turn Structure:** one **maneuver** + one **action**, or two maneuvers.  
- **Actions include:** melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- **Manuevers include:** reloading, DRR action rolls like dodge or parry, rushing about.
- **Free Actions:** speech, drawing weapons, invoking blessings already prepared.
- **Blessings** that help can occur whenever.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** that adversely affect a target go with ranged. 

## Damage & Healing

- **Weapons** deal damage from **d4 to d12**, depending on size and type.  
- **Vitality (PCs)** and **Vigor (NPCs)** decrease when damage is taken.  
- **Armor Save:** roll armor to reduce incoming damage; armor or gear may be sacrificed to absorb grievous wounds.  
- **Short Rest:** recover **Prowess + Spirit + d4**.  
- **Full Rest:** restore all Vitality.

## Criticals & Fumbles

- **Nat20:** automatic success, **double damage**, and grievous wound rules apply.  
- **Nat1:** consult the fumble table (e.g., strike an ally, stumble, drop or damage gear).  
- **Avoiding Fumbles:** higher DR values help reduce the likelihood of suffering a catastrophic outcome.

## Grappling

- **Escape:** roll Awareness to break free.  
- **Control:** roll off using weapon or grappling skills.  
- **Effect:** the winner may inflict DR penalties or drain Vitality.

## Special Rules

- **Point Blank:** melee-range surprise; attack automatically hits (except on a Nat1).  
- **Fire Damage:**  
  - Torch: **d4**  
  - Campfire: **d6**  
  - Lamp oil: **d8**  
  - Pyre: **d10**

# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.
- Success = establishing a church; then GM introduces the next mission.
- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.
