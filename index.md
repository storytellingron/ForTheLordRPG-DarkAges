## Purpose
- Player characters are **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** — not divine beings.
- The focus of the game is **evangelism, fellowship, discipleship, and church planting**.
- Campaigns blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay
1. The Grande Minister or GM prepares missions, encounters, maps, and NPCs.  
2. Players roleplay missionaries and gain bonuses from Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.  
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success often results in conversions or establishing churches.
4. Roleplaying involves investigation, inquiry, conversions, reconciliations and more! It isn't just about heroics and gaining rewards, but about the mindset of evangelism & planting churches to change the World.
5. Rewards: Gain **Glory Points** to improve Traits, skills, armor fitting and blessings.  
6. Salvage: Treasures found during missions may be used for gear and supplies, with excess given back to the Church.
7. As the Church grows, it can help support and give missions.

## Dice System

Most rolls in the game are resolved by rolling a **d20**, applying your **Trait** bonus or penalty, and adding the die of the **Die Ranks**.

To resolve a roll:

**`d20 + Trait + DRs`**

### Die Ranks (DRs)

DRs represent upgraded die with a skill, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and situational advantages.  
For the simplest version of the game:

- **1 DR → d4**  
- **2 DR → d6**  
- **3 DR → d8**  
- **4 DR → d10**  
- **5 DR → d12**

### Simple Game
In the simple game, characters are limited to **5 DR**, a single bonus die for any rolls. This caps any bonuses from skill, gear, blessings, situational bonuses. This helps simplify the game for both GMs and players. The GM should accordingly, keep NPCs and encounters at relatively low stats, especially armor saves! Start with easier challenges, i.e. poor bandits, feral vermin.

### The Dice Pool (Advanced)
Incorporating the advanced version should come after players and GMs understand the basic rolls for combat & encounters, how to use blessings and how to advance their character's skills and armor with Glory Points.
- **Explanation:** Dice Pools solves the common RPG issue of advanced characters becoming too powerful as they upgrade. As one gains more and more DRs, their bonus gets more diffused and costly. Yet there is still some advancement. And new players can join with veterans and still contribute.

Once a character accumulates more than 5 DR from skills, equipment, blessings, etc., these DRs form a **Dice Pool** of multiple dice:

1. For every **5 DR**, add one **d12** to the pool.  
2. If any DR remains (1–4), add one die based on the remainder:
   - **1 DR → d4**
   - **2 DR → d6**
   - **3 DR → d8**
   - **4 DR → d10**

Dice Pools are written like this:

**`{d12, d8}kh`** → roll all dice in the braces; **keep highest** (with special 7+ rule).

The acting player rolls all dice in their pool, but only the highest result gets added to the d20 total, unless modified by 7+ results (see below).


## Rolling the Dice

To make a check:

1. Roll **d20**.  
2. Roll your DR die or full Dice Pool.  
3. Identify the **single highest** die result.  
4. Add together:
   - d20 result  
   - Trait bonus or penalty  
   - Highest DR / Dice Pool result  
   - Any additional 7+ results  
5. Compare the total to the Difficulty.

### The 7+ Rule

Any die rolled in the Dice Pool that shows **7 or higher**:

- **Negates a natural 1** (fumble) on the d20.  
- **Adds to the total**, even if it is *not* the highest die in the dice pool.

### Summary of Dice System

-  **d20** plus a specific **Trait** bonus/penalty.
- **1–5 DR**: Basic single DR die (d4–d12).  
- **6+ DR**: Advanced **Dice Pool**.  
  - **Every 5 DR → d12**  
  - **Remainder DR → d4 / d6 / d8 / d10**  
- **Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ dice** also add to the total and negate Nat1.


## Difficulty
- Default Difficulty: **12**  
- Meet or exceed the Difficulty to succeed.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Opposed checks:** both sides roll; higher total wins. This is for evangelism, trade, persuasion, interrogation but also for grappling and blocking each other.  
- **Treacherous terrain:** GM rolls the character’s **Armor Save** to add to the Difficulty. This gives the sense of the armor's burden. Only apply the basic Armor Save versus if the character upgraded it with Glory Points. 
- **Extreme conditions:** GM may combine situational DRs (darkness, wet, mud, storm, under attack, etc...) to the **Armor Save** DR, then rolling. For easy play, no more than 5DRs total.
- **Explanation:** This gives both GM and players an easy way to understand the situation and lets the dice decide how hard it is.


## Combat
- **Surprise / Ambush:** Opponents make an Awareness roll-off. Use highest Awareness from each group. Winners may get first free attack. The GM may give the highest Armor Save DRs of each group, as a bonus, to the other group!
- **Faith Points** are rolled now, to be used for this encounter.  
- **Initiative Order:** loaded crossbows → ranged → spears → claws → light weapons → heavy weapons. May do an Awareness roll-off if similar. GM may use discretion.  
- **Turn Structure:** one **maneuver** + one **action**, or two maneuvers.  
- **Actions include:** melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- **Manuevers include:** reloading, moving, using the special rule for DRR action rolls like dodge or parry.
- **Free Actions:** speech, drawing weapons, invoking a helpful blessing.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** that adversely affect a target are in the ranged initiative order.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** of any sort, may only be used once per turn.

### Damage
- **Weapons** deal damage from **d4 to d12**, depending on size and type. In advanced play, these may go beyond 5DRs.
- **Vitality (PCs)** and **Vigor (NPCs)** number decreases when damage is taken. Think of these as exhaustion, cuts & bruise, but not grievous wounds.
- **Armor Save:** roll armor to reduce incoming damage. A mininum of 1 damage if the weapon die is higher than the armor save DR.
- A character at **0 Vitality or Less** is out and triggers the **Life Saves** rules.
- A villain at **0 Vigor or Less** is deceased. If missionaries want to save them, at GMs descrition, and great healing rolls, they may.

### Healing, Vitality
- **Short Rest:** recover **Prowess or Spirit + d4**.  
- **Full Rest:** restore all Vitality.

### Criticals & Fumbles
- **Nat20:** automatic success, **double damage**, and **Grievous Wounds rule** applies, if advanced rules used.  
- **Nat1:** consult the fumble table (e.g., strike an ally, stumble, drop or damage gear).  
- **Avoiding Fumbles:** higher DR values help reduce the likelihood of suffering a catastrophic outcome, the 7+ Rule.

#### Nat1 Fumble Chart

When a player rolls a **Natural 1** on a d20 attack roll, roll **1d6** on this table:

| d6 | Fumble Result |
|----|---------------|
| 1  | **Hit an ally!** Roll weapon damage as normal; they may apply their Armor Save. If there, otherwise, do #2. |
| 2  | **Hit yourself.** Roll your own weapon damage and apply Armor Save. |
| 3  | **Fall prone.** Must use next manuever to get up, take **d4 damage** with no Armor Save. |
| 4  | **Self-stagger.** You stumble fiercly about, take **d4 damage** with no Armor Save). |
| 5  | **Weapon damaged.** Your weapon is damaged. Reduce it by one DR of damage.|
| 6  | **Item damaged.** If ranged, mark ammo as low, then depleted. If shield is in use mark as damaged, then destroyed. Or randomly pick a gear. Returning to town can replenish or repair.|

### Life Saves & Conditions

When a character’s **Vitality is 0 or less**, they must make **Life Saves** each turn until stabilized or dead.

**Life Save Roll:**  
`d20 + Prowess or Spirit`  
**Difficulty:** 12
- + Grievous Wound DR if Advanced play.

- **Success:** Recover **+d4 Vitality**.  
- **Failure:** Lose **−d6 Vitality**.

A character dies when their Vitality reaches the **negative of their maximum Vitality**.

Life Saves continue each turn until the character stabilizes, recovers above 0 Vitality, or dies.

This represents the struggle to stay alive in the face of grievous injury or shock — requiring both physical resolve and spiritual fortitude.

## Skill Examples

Below are examples of common skill uses, the Traits they rely on, and whether the roll is against **Difficulty 12** or a **roll-off** against an NPC or creature. These denote possible skills and upgrading them. Players can come up with any skill, with GM's approval on scope & usage. The default 12 denotes quick easy gameplay but can be changed by GM due to the challenge.

### Prowess
- Climbing walls, cliffs, or trees — vs 12 + Armor Save  
- Jumping, tumbling, or leaping gaps — vs 12 + Armor Save 
- Grappling or shoving an opponent — roll-off  
- Dodging thrown objects — roll-off
- Strength tests — vs 12
  
### Awareness
- Spotting hidden objects or basic clues — vs 12  
- Noticing danger, traps, or ambush — vs 12  
- Tracking someone in mud or snow — vs 12  
- Listening through a door — vs 12
- Sneaking, hiding against others — roll off, Armor Saves may be used? 

### Savvy

  (armor-smithing, weapon forging, leather-working, sewing, cooking, engineering, repairing structures, building tools, brewing, and other disciplined crafts)


### Society
(Most Society tasks are **roll-offs**, as they involve people.)
- Persuading a stubborn villager — roll-off  
- Performance, storytelling, entertain — roll-off  
- Negotiating with merchants or lords — roll-off  
- Reading a crowd’s mood — vs 12
- Understanding a social situation - vs 12
- Perceiving skullduggery - vs 12 or roll-off  

These examples show how Traits map to skills and give the GM easy targets to call upon during play.

---

## Situational DR Modifiers

The GM may add **+1 DR** for each element making the task more difficult. For the simple game, the max is 5DRs and the GM should average it out to about 3DR if called for. Describing each major DR factor, the GM then rolls the corresponding die infront of players and adds it to the difficulty. This will include the armor save, again to a max of 5DRs for beginning game.

Here is a list of colorful examples a GM may describe:

muddy, wet, stormy, icy, windy, dark, dim-lit, smoky, foggy, swaying, crowded, noisy, echoing, slippery, sweaty, cold, freezing, burning hot, feverish, thorny, tangled, cramped, narrow, uneven, unstable, debris-strewn, cluttered, haunted-feeling, blood-stained, nauseating, smelly, foul, dizzying, panicked, rushed, time-pressured, hungry, thirsty, exhausted, shivering, blinded by sun, half-blind from smoke, disoriented, intimidated, overwhelmed, encumbered, carrying someone, startled, distracted, frightened, desperate, dripping wet, ankle-deep water, knee-deep mud, waist-deep snow, insects swarming, wolves howling, bells ringing, torches sputtering, arrows whistling past, armor rattling, horse bucking, shield slipping, cloak snagging on brambles.

This list is not exhaustive — it exists to inspire rich descriptions of tense, gritty challenges.

## Advanced Play

This can be introduced after GMs and players get the hang of combat, rolling skills, blessings, roleplaying and upgrading with Glory Points. If a long campaign is desired.

- [Special Rules](#special-rules)

---

## Die Rank Results (DRR)
- On success: (Total − Difficulty) ÷ 2 = **DRR bonus**.  
- On failure: (Difficulty − Total) ÷ 2 = **DRR penalty**.  
- DRR may be applied immediately to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties like damage or gear wear.  
- **Explanation:** GM can ignore this or use to help define the results of a roll.

---

## Penalty Dice

Players and NPCs can gain **Penalty Dice** as -DRs for various reasons.  
They **do not** apply these penalties directly to their rolls.

Instead, the **GM applies Penalty Dice** to major factors like:

- **Difficulty** (making a task harder)  
- **Defense** (making a target harder to hit)

The GM rolls it separately and adds it to opposing rolls, defenses, or difficulties.

The penalty DR is applied to **only one factor per turn**.  
The GM may also forget or forgo using them.

### Sources of Penalty  Dice  
The following examples combine to form a character’s total **Penalty Dice**:

- Temporary pains & stuns (not fatal)  
- Temporary frustrations, failed rolls (not fatal)  
- Curses, fear  
- Blurred or blind vision  
- Minor afflictions (nausea, stings, rashes)
- Over burdened.
**Below are Fatal if beyond 5DRs**  
- Grievous Wounds  
- Afflictions such as **poison, disease, sickness**

## Afflictions

Poison, disease, and similar conditions are treated as **Grievous Wounds**.  
If an Affliction’s DR penalty becomes **worse than 5 DR**, it is **fatal**. There is no Life Save.

Afflictions are gained from:
- Failing disease or poison rolls.  
- Prolonged exposure to harsh environments.  
- Curses or spiritual attacks (GM discretion).  
- Failing specific encounter hazards.

**Recovery:**  
Afflictions can be removed through:

- Time and rest,  
- Medical care,  
- Herbal treatments,  
- Prayer or blessings,  
- Completing certain quests.

The GM determines the steps and difficulty of recovery.

## Grievous Wounds

A **Grievous Wound** represents severe bodily harm. These wounds occur when:

- A character is struck by a **Nat20** attack in combat, or  
- A situation involves extreme failure or massive harm (GM discretion).

### Grievous Wound Calculation (Nat20 Attacks)

1. Roll **double weapon damage**.  
2. Apply the target’s **Armor Save** to reduce the damage.  
3. Any damage that gets through:
   - Reduces **Vitality/Vigor** as normal, and  
   - Is used to determine the wound’s severity:  
     **Half of the damage taken = the Grievous Wound’s Penalty Dice.**

This DR penalty represents the wound’s seriousness.

### Shifting the Wound to Armor

After determining the wound’s DR penalty, the target may:

- Move some or all of the **wound DR** onto their **armor’s DR** instead.
- This reduces the armor by that many DRs.
- If doing so reduces armor to **0 DR**, the armor is **destroyed**.
- A character may also **sacrifice a shield or great helm** to completely cancel the Grievous Wound from that attack.

### Effects of Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds impose -DR **Penalty Dice** that affects:

- Life Save rolls when at 0 Vitality
- Penalties to one roll per turn. The GM picks one, rolls the Grievous Wound DR and adds it to the difficulty of that roll. He can choose other options, but only one per turn against the grievously wounded. He may forget or forgo it. The player never has to deal with the penalty in determining their own rolls.

These wounds persist until treated through appropriate care, skills, or blessings. Healing such are noted in the skills, Miracle of Healing and DRR rules.


### Healing Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds require intentional healing. They do not recover through normal Vitality rest.

The Difficulty to heal a Grievous Wound is:

**Difficulty = 12 + Grievous Wound DR**

A healing attempt produces a **DRR**. Any DR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.

#### Order of Healing (Per Day)

1. **Miracle of Healing** (Nun / Blessed)  
2. **Healer or Surgeon**  
3. **Nightly Rest Healing** (required)

Each step may reduce the wound’s DR through DRR.

##### Miracle of Healing (Blessing)

The Nun or Blessed character acts **first** because her miracle is the safest method.

For the Miracle of Healing:

- The nun adds **Faith Points as DRs** directly into her Dice Pool.  
- She may add **any of her own healing-related skills** (Healing, Surgery, Mothering, Herbalism, etc.) as additional DRs.  
- She rolls **Spirit + {Dice Pool}kh** against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- Any DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- **Failure never worsens the wound.**  
- May be used **once per day**.

This represents divine aid working through her skills and devotion.

##### Healing Through Skills (Healer or Surgeon)

After the Nun’s attempt (if any), a healer may treat the wound:

- Add **Trait + Healing/Surgery skills** and any situational DRs.  
- Roll against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- A disastrous failure may worsen the wound.

May be attempted **once per day**.

##### Rest Healing (Nightly Required Roll)

Every full night of rest, the wounded character must roll:

**Prowess or Spirit + {any chosen DRs}kh vs (12 + Wound DR)**

##### The Pain Rule (Special)

If the patient chooses to add **any** of their own DRs  
(e.g., Medical knowledge, Blessings, Inspired Die, Hope DR, etc.):

- The GM must roll the **Wound DR as a penalty die** (representing pain, trembling, shock).  
- The result of this penalty die is **added to the Difficulty** for that night.

This makes self-healing risky but potentially rewarding.

A DRR above the final Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
Failure or very low DRR may worsen the wound (GM discretion).

The Rest Healing roll is **mandatory** until the wound is fully healed.


##### Resolving Complete Healing

When the Wound DR reaches **0**, the Grievous Wound is healed.

Vitality may then recover normally.

---

## Special Rules

### Grappling (Simple Version)

- A grapple is a struggle between two combatants in close combat.
- To attempt a grapple, the attacker and defender each roll:
  `d20 + Awarenes and/or Weapon/Grappling Skill` to escape or grapple.
- Compare results:
  - The **higher total wins** the grapple struggle.
  - Subtract the lesser roll from the greater; **halve** the difference.
  - The winner may split that DR between:
    - **Vitality drain** (minor injury) and/or  
    - **Penalties** to the target’s future rolls.
    - **Escaping** bonus to move away, defense or counter strike.
- If the defender wins a roll, they **escape** the grapple and negate its effects.
- Each turn, both sides roll opposed grappling again, carrying over prior penalties or bonuses.
  
### Point Blank & Ambush

- Point Blank applies only at **melee range** against a target that is:
  - **Unaware**,  
  - **Not moving**, and  
  - Within reach of the attacker.

- With **handheld guns or daggers**, the **first** Point Blank attack:
  - **Hits on anything except a Nat1**  
  - Is treated as a **Nat20 hit**  
  - **Ignores Armor Saves**  
  - May target a **specific limb or location**

- **Other melee weapons** cannot gain the Point Blank Nat20 effect, but:
  - Still hit on anything except **Nat1**  
  - Do **not** ignore armor  
  - Inflict a **−1 DR wound** on a successful hit

- **Grappling** at Point Blank:
  - Hits on anything except **Nat1**  
  - Gains **+2 DR** to the attempt  
  - Can still be resisted normally

### Afflictions

**Poison, disease, sickness.**  
These are part of **Grievous Wounds**.

- At **0 Vitality**, **Life Saves are not necessary**.

**Causes:**  
- Strain, accidents, over-exertion  
- Not caused by violent attacks  

**Recovery:**  
- Requires **recovery time**, shaking it off, or minor first aid.

**Note:**  
Exhaustion is **not** part of Grievous Wounds or Afflictions for healing or dying,  
but its **DR penalties are added** to any penalty rolls.

---

### Falling

- **+1 DR damage per 10 feet** fallen.  
- A fall is a **critical**, dealing **double damage** with possible **Grievous Wound**.  
- Character **may roll Armor Save** to reduce damage.

---

## Traits
- **Prowess**: melee, strength, grappling, intimidation.
- **Awareness**: defense bonus, perception, dodging, sneaking.
- **Savvy**: contraptions, locks, traps, repairs.
- **Spirit**: faith points, courage, preaching, rebuking evil.
- **Intellect**: crafting, languages, history, medicine.
- **Society**: persuasion, leadership, performance, teaching.

## Callings

## Gear & Burden
- Categories: Heavy (II), Medium (III), Light (IIII).
- All gear, weapons, armor are categorzied into the three areas.
- Players can only carry the amount of each category withou a DR penalty.
- Backpacks, sacks, belts with scabbards can increase it.
- Overburden = -1DR or Armor Save DR penalty.
- Donkey + cart can carry heavy loads but are not immediately accessible, free for the Patron Lady.
- **Wear & Tear:** Nat1 can add low to ammo or damaged to gear. Next would be depleted or destroyed. 
- **Repair:** Difficulty = 12, a success repairs depleted or damaged. Must have time & tools.
- **Repair Armor:** Difficulty = 12, a success repairs one DR of damage. Must have time & tools.
- **Time & Tools:** time would be one repair per long rest, specific tool kits for the category.

## Power of Faith
Faith Points fuel blessings and miracles.

- Characters have have two sets of Faith Points derived from Spirit + DR skill.
   - **Faith for Each Encounter** — used during combat, danger, spiritual conflict, or moments of tension. This pool refreshes between encounters and can only be used then.
   - **Faith for the Day** — used during calm scenes, travel, roleplay, teaching, preaching, or preparation. This pool may be spent for encounters out of desperation but is meant for daily or session use. A GM may only allow these faith points as the total for a resting or church session. It may be for the day, a game session, or a period of time, based on GM's descretion.
- Faith Points are spent when invoking a blessing.
- Each Faith Point spent becomes **Die Ranks (DR)**.

**Deliverance is always required.**  
Deliverance determines **how strong** the blessing is. Faith Points spent on Deliverance convert directly into DRs that define the blessing’s effect.

Additional Faith Points may be spent to shape the blessing:
- **Deluge** — how many targets are affected beyond first  
- **Duration** — how long the blessing lasts  
- **Duress** — how hard the blessing is to resist  
- **Distance** — how far away the target is  
Note: There is potential for a result of 1 denoting a failure to go beyond 1 person, round and so on.

Blessings aiding allies are usually **free actions**.  
Blessings used against opposition usually require an **action**.
Only one blessing can be done per turn. Only one helpful blessing per recipient per turn.

## Blessings of the Clergy

**Bless.** DRs added to an ally’s *to-hit* or *skill* roll. Bless may not be added to other blessings.

**Exorcism.** This blessing drains vigor from unholy or possessed beings, directly harming demonic and evil spirits. They receive no armor saves or dark protections, though stronger ones may attempt a resist. Exorcism is intended for dire situations and truly evil foes.

**Heal.** A lasting effect that restores vitality immediately. Heal does not restore grievous wounds.

**Holy Mace.** Deliverance grants a die rank bonus to hit and adds holy damage, but this blessing requires Duration to remain active. It is best used on a one-handed mace or hammer made for, or blessed by, the Church. The weapon becomes holy for both to-hit and damage and is especially effective against unholy or evil beings. It ignores any unholy armor save bonuses.

**Preach.** Grants a bonus die to Spirit rolls when preaching or persuading groups to turn from evil ways during non-combat situations. Deliverance determines the effect. Use Deluge for crowds, where a d4 affects small groups and a d12 affects large crowds. Duration and Duress are not necessary.

**Prophecy.** Performed between missions during prayer or meditation. Faith spent allows the clergy to roll a die rank result, which is saved for future use and may be added after a roll’s result is known. Only one prophecy may be active at a time.

**Protection.** Grants a bonus to Defense and must be invoked before an attack occurs. The clergy rolls the effect, and all affected characters add the result to their Defense.

**Rebuke.** Removes vigor from human enemies during combat or against enraged, violent mobs. It ignores armor saves. Leaders may resist. At zero vigor, enemies may flee or fall to their knees in humility or humiliation.

**Resist!** Grants ranks to resist curses, fear, or afflictions before they take effect. This blessing does not cleanse an existing curse or affliction.

**Revive.** Those who have died cannot be healed. However, if a character has fallen during the current encounter, the clergy may attempt to revive them. The clergy must successfully Heal the fallen character, bringing their negative vitality to 1. Failure means the soul has passed from this world into the hands of the Lord.

**Special Miracle.** Once in a great while, a clergy member may spend all their Faith Points to plead for a special miracle. The situation must be dire or epic—a moment of great need. The GM sets a difficulty using situational factors, while the believer may add prayer, meditation, fellowship, preparation, and similar acts. A successful roll is required for the miracle to occur.

**Studious.** Faith Points may be added to academic or scholarly inquiries, such as culture, history, Biblical knowledge, the occult, philosophy, social matters, nature, medicine, crafts, or similar fields, at the GM’s discretion.

## Blessings of the Sisterhood

**Call Out.** May grant a bonus die to an ally’s Defense, used immediately against a single attack. This call may be used at any time during a round, even after the attack result is known. The effect lasts for one turn only.

**Cleansing.** Grants a blessed die to help one resist an ongoing curse or ailment that they failed to resist initially. This new resistance roll may be applied once per day to an afflicted soul during a rest.

**Divination.** Through prayer and meditation before a mission, a nun may receive a vision of future things. At the GM’s discretion, this may provide clues, warnings, or mission information, often mysterious, vague, or symbolic. The nun rolls this as a skill using DRs. The GM may interpret the results as DRRs, each DR thereof a clue, vision, warning or answer to a prayer.

**Heal.** A lasting effect that restores vitality. Heal does not restore grievous wounds.

**Hope.** Grants oneself or an ally a bonus die usable on their next roll only. It may apply to anything, including damage rolls and non-d20 rolls.

**I See An Angel.** Used only once per mission or session, this blessing expends all remaining Faith Points. Die Ranks are split between attack, damage, and duration. The Angel cannot be harmed, and its attacks are made with a holy sword that ignores all armor saves. The Angel may be deeply intimidating, especially if it harms unbelievers; fear, blindness, or paralysis tests may apply. Resistance is Spirit 12 plus total DRs used. The Angel may not protect everyone present. Upon the Angel’s arrival, the nun faints and is inconsequential to foes while it remains. She recovers shortly after the Angel departs.

**Miracle of Healing.** This blessing specifically heals grievous wounds. It may combine with medical skills and requires a roll exceeding the difficulty. It may be instantaneous and will not worsen the wound if it fails. This miracle is separate from other medical attempts and may only be rolled once per wound per day. It may be used in combat in desperate situations but will not benefit from other skills.

**Plea.** A desperate plea that may be used at any time and may stop someone from committing an evil act. It can trigger a denouement roll or be resolved as a direct roll-off against the target’s Spirit, anger, and vile bonuses.

**Repel.** A form of rebuke that causes enemies to flee the caster for the duration. Those affected generally seek to avoid further confrontation as they withdraw from the nun. Duration and duress (if strong willed) are all that is required.

## Blessings of the Paladin

**Armor of God.** Grants a second holy armor save for the duration of the blessing.

**Holy Weapon.** The paladin’s weapon is imbued with the Holy effect for the duration, canceling unholy armor saves. Gaining a specially crafted weapon or having one blessed by a great saint may inspire the faith necessary to invoke this blessing. It only requires duration.

**Glory.** Grants a holy die (DR based on Deliverance) to combat damage rolls and must be declared before striking. If the attack misses, the Faith Points spent are lost. Glory may use Duration, but its duration counts down even if attacks miss.

**Perseverance.** Adds vitality to the paladin so they may fight on. This does not heal lost vitality; instead, the granted vitality lasts for the remainder of the encounter and is always depleted before normal vitality. No Duration is required.

**Righteous Anger.** Using Duration only, this blessing lowers the Critical Roll threshold by 1 DR. The DR may be upgraded using Glory Points. The paladin must still hit the target’s normal Defense for the critical to take effect. This is not the same as a natural 20 automatic hit.

**Warrior’s Sacrifice.** This blessing may only be used on oneself. Each die rank grants vitality and compels enemies to pursue and attack the paladin alone. Forgo Duration cost, the effect ends once the paladin has fallen or the enemy is vanquished. This also condemns the enemy to violent means. Leaders may resist this temptation.


## Glory Points

**Glory Points (GP)** represent long-term growth earned through faithful action, service, sacrifice, and participation. They are the primary method of character improvement.

---

### Gaining Glory Points

Glory Points are typically gained at a rate of **1 GP per meaningful accomplishment**. Common ways to gain 1 GP include:

- Showing up to play
- Converting non-believers
- Defeating or bringing about the surrender of a stronger foe
- Uncovering a pagan plot
- Defeating, exposing, or stopping that plot
- Establishing a church
- Spending time serving at a church (building, mediating, training, teaching)
- Giving large sums to a church
- GM awards for miraculous, exceptional, or story-significant reasons

This list is illustrative, not exhaustive. The GM has final discretion.

---

### Tracking Glory Points

Players keep a **running total** of Glory Points, tracking both **total earned** and **unspent** points.

**Example:**  
Glory Points (Total / Unspent): **30 / 2**

Unspent Glory Points may be saved indefinitely.

---

### When Glory Points Are Spent

Glory Points are generally spent **between missions**, during periods of rest, service, and reflection—most often while staying at a church (new or old).

During this time, characters may train, study, pray, and serve, then describe how their Glory Points are spent on upgrades.

---

## Spending Glory Points

Nearly anything that uses **Die Ranks (DR)** may be upgraded using Glory Points.

### General Rule for DR Upgrades

For most upgrades:

- **Cost = the Die Rank being gained**

**Examples:**
- Sewing DR 3 costs **3 GP**
- Sword To-Hit DR 3 costs **3 GP**

---

### Trait Advancement (Special Rule)

Traits use a unique and more expensive cost formula.

- **Cost = old Trait rating + new Trait rating**
- Minimum cost is **1 GP**

**Example:**  
Trait +3 → +4 costs **7 GP**

**Trait limits:**
- Trait **5** is the normal maximum
- Advancing above 5 requires GM approval
- Increasing a Trait above 5 also requires permanently reducing another Trait by **–1**

---

### Skills

- There is no hard limit on the types of skills a character may have
- Skills grant a **DR bonus** when used
- Skills are associated with a Trait based on GM and player agreement
- Adding or improving a skill follows the normal DR upgrade rule

---

### Vitality

Starting Vitality:
- **Men:** Prowess + 6 + d6
- **Women:** Prowess + 4 + d4

**Vitality upgrades:**
- Divide current total Vitality by **4**
- Round down to determine the **GP cost**
- Each upgrade grants:
  - **+d6 Vitality** for men
  - **+d4 Vitality** for women

---

### Faith Points

Faith Points are improved by adding Die Ranks to **Spirit** for Faith use.

- Each upgrade adds a **DR bonus** to Spirit
- This bonus applies to:
  - **Faith for Each Encounter**
  - **Faith for the Day**

Faith Point upgrades follow the normal DR cost rule.

---

## Character Classes

---

## Holy Warrior Calling

Holy Warriors are martial servants of the faith, trained in weapons, armor, and disciplined combat. These abilities and upgrades are most commonly associated with Holy Warriors, but many may be learned or used by other callings through training, skills, or Glory Point investment.

---

### Weapon Upgrades

Weapon upgrades apply to a **specific weapon type**.

**Weapon To-Hit**
- **Melee:** Uses **Prowess**
- **Ranged:** Uses **Awareness**
- Add DRs as a skill to that weapon type

**Weapon Damage**
- Damage DR is upgraded per weapon type:
  - DR 1 = d4
  - DR 2 = d6
  - DR 3 = d8
  - DR 4 = d10
  - DR 5 = d12
- Damage DR may form a Dice Pool that keeps the highest result

**Weapon Upgrade Notes**
- Weapon upgrades may combine skill and gear improvements
- Track upgrades per individual weapon
- If a weapon is destroyed, only that weapon’s upgrades are lost, not the skill. It can be transferred to a like weapon.
- Glory Point cost is based on the **total DRs of the weapon**, not separated by skill or gear
- Do not divide upgrades to reduce Glory Point cost

---

### Armor Save

Armor Save improvements reflect continual refitting and adjustment.

- Armor Save increases as DRs
- Applies only to a **specific suit of armor**
- If the armor is destroyed, upgrades do not transfer
- Armor is hand-made and considered unique

---

### Combat Skills

**Shield Work (Prowess)**  
A character may use a shield as a DRR for Defense instead of the default +2. Any unused DRs may be shifted into offense as a shield-bash attack (treated as a club).

**Two Weapons (Prowess / Awareness)**  
Still counts as **one attack**. Each weapon must be upgraded separately. Only light or medium weapons may be used. Combine DRs for a single attack. On a hit, choose which weapon’s damage applies, or use one weapon to parry. Its success adds to the other weapon’s attack and damage. This is an advanced skill and should only be used when well understood.

**Weapon Damage from Prowess**  
Adds +1 damage per point of Prowess (up to current Prowess). Melee only. Glory Point cost equals the number of points gained.

**Perseverance (Second Wind)**  
A character may spend a DR to heal themselves, using both a maneuver and an action. This ability may be used multiple times per combat, up to the character’s Prowess in DRs.

---

## Mercenary Calling

Mercenaries specialize in movement, positioning, opportunism, and survival in chaotic combat. These maneuver skills are most often associated with mercenaries, scouts, and hardened fighters, but many may be learned or used by other callings through training, skills, or Glory Point investment.

---

### Maneuver Skills

**Aim (Awareness)**  
Everyone gets the first 1DR for free, but it can be upgraded with GPs. It takes up the entire manuever, so one cannot use if one has moved. Aim does not generate a DRR; it applies directly to the proceeding ranged attack roll.

**Charge (Prowess)**  
If there is sufficient space—most commonly on the first round of combat—a character may charge using their Prowess bonus only. If successful, the DRR gained against the target’s Defense may be split between To-Hit and Damage. If the charger is successfully struck before completing the attack (such as by arrows or spears), the charge is negated. Order of attacks is still resolved normally. A natural 1 fumble results in **two fumble roll results**.

**Dodge (Awareness)**  
The character rolls this skill against Difficulty 12 and the attacker’s Armor Save. The resulting DRR may be added to Defense against known attacks.

**Grraggh!!**  
Each DR reduces one grievous wound DR that the character would receive in combat. This ability may be used **once per encounter**. Vitality damage still applies normally.

**Guard (Prowess)**  
Each DR adds to a Prowess vs Prowess roll-off. If successful, the character intercepts an attack intended for the guarded ally. The difference, as a DRR, may be added to the defender’s Defense.

---

### Advanced Maneuver Skills

**Parry (Prowess / Awareness)**  
May be rolled against one melee attack. If the roll exceeds the attacker’s roll, the strike is canceled and the DRR may be added to the character’s next To-Hit roll. If the parry fails, the character may still attack later in the round, but if struck, they lose their attack. Certain weapons may grant bonuses to this roll.

**Seek Cover (Awareness)**  
A full defensive maneuver similar to Dodge, but gains additional DRs based on available cover. The result is added to Defense as DRs in a Dice Pool. This skill uses both maneuver and action. If the roll is high, the result may be kept each round, re-rolled, or the entire skill may be re-rolled on the next turn.

**Sneak Attack**  
Grants DRs that may be applied to either To-Hit or Damage when attacking from surprise or from a flank. This may be used only while the target is unaware, surprised, or engaged and unaware of the flanker, at the GM’s discretion.

---

## Scout Calling

Scouts specialize in awareness, movement, survival, and reading the land. These skills are most commonly associated with scouts, hunters, and pathfinders, but many may be learned or used by other callings through training, skills, or Glory Point investment.

---

### Field & Survival Skills

**Boatswain (Savvy)**  
Handling, maintenance, and care of boats, rafts, and river barges.

**Leather Repair (Savvy)**  
Repairing leather and brigandine armor (metal plates sewn into leather). By rolling for a DRR, the character may remove DR wear and tear from leather-based gear and armor. Basic leather tools are required. Difficulty is **12 + existing wear and tear penalty**.

**Hunting (Awareness)**  
Adds DRs to tracking, scouting, and perception related specifically to hunting.

**Foraging (Awareness)**  
Adds DRs to tracking, surveying, and perception related to gathering edible or useful flora.

**Camping / Nature (Awareness)**  
Adds DRs to surveying, perception, and trap detection when selecting, setting up, or evaluating campsites, or when scouting discovered sites.

---

### Scouting & Awareness Skills

**Tracking (Awareness)**  
Each DRR provides a clue or new piece of information about tracks, disturbed ground, tactile signs, or items left behind.

**Surveying / Scouting (Awareness)**  
Each DRR provides pertinent information about terrain, landmarks, or features across the land. Requires appropriate position or vantage, whether near or distant. This skill focuses on the broader environment rather than tracks.

**Perception (Awareness / Intellect / Savvy)**  
Each DRR reveals notable information unrelated to tracks or past activity. This focuses on recognizing important features, objects, or arrangements that indicate what is currently happening or normally occurs in an area.

**Detect Traps (Savvy)**  
Used to locate and understand traps. DRRs may be spent to avoid, trigger safely, disable, reset, modify, or repurpose traps.

---

## Clergy Calling

Clergy focus on spiritual authority, prayer, guidance, and confronting evil through faith rather than arms. These upgrades and skills are most commonly associated with clergy, priests, and ministers, but many may be learned or used by other callings through training, blessings, or Glory Point investment.

---

### Blessing Upgrades

**Faith Points (Spirit)**  
Faith Points are gained as DRs for each intense encounter and for each new day (a long period of rest or peace). When used, Faith DRs are **added together** rather than keeping the highest die.

**Gain a New Blessing**  
Gaining a new Blessing costs Glory Points equal to the total number of Blessings the character will have after gaining it. Blessings are generally gained between missions during rest, prayer, or meditation, often at a church or monastery. Roleplaying this process is encouraged.

**Courage / Resist Fear (Spirit)**  
Adds DRs to resist fear, curses, and magical or spiritual effects. Particularly useful when confronting dark magic, unholy forces, or possession.

**Comprehending Evil (Spirit)**  
Allows the character to detect evil influences, curses, or possession, and to gain insight into their powers and intent. Grants bonuses to interrogation and discernment involving evil entities.

---

### Clergy Skills

**Praying (Spirit)**  
Rolled against Difficulty 12 in peaceful settings such as a campsite. Additional DRs may apply for group prayer, aid, psalm books, prayer items, church settings, and comforts. The resulting DRR converts into **Inspired Dice**, which may be split among the group.

**Preaching (Spirit)**  
Used to convert or persuade the calm and receptive. A DRR may raise a target’s conversion level. Failure may reduce progress or cause complications.

**Rebuking (Spirit)**  
Used to pacify the violent by reducing them to 0 Vigor. Rebuking directly lowers Vigor using the Dice Pool total. Minions generally cannot resist; elite or powerful foes may attempt to do so.

**Consoling (Spirit)**  
Strengthens the faithful by granting a DRR that may be used for a single resist against a specific spiritual or mental adversity. This skill may also be used to gather information from those in distress.


---
## Sisterhood Calling

The Sisterhood represents nuns and sisters devoted to care, faith, courage, and subtle influence. While most closely associated with women of the Church, many of these abilities may be learned or used by others through training, blessings, or Glory Point investment.

# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.

- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.
