## Purpose
- Player characters are **missionaries, saints, or evangelists** — not divine beings.
- The focus of the game is **evangelism, fellowship, discipleship, and church planting**.
- Campaigns blend medieval history, folklore, and Christian storytelling.

## Gameplay
1. The Grande Minister or GM prepares missions, encounters, maps, and NPCs.  
2. Players roleplay missionaries and gain bonuses from Traits, skills, gear, and blessings.  
3. Dice rolls resolve challenges; success often results in conversions or establishing churches.
4. Roleplaying involves investigation, inquiry, conversions, reconciliations and more! It isn't just about heroics and gaining rewards, but about the mindset of evangelism & planting churches to change the World.
5. Rewards: Gain **Glory Points** to improve Traits, skills, armor fitting and blessings.  
6. Salvage: Treasures found during missions may be used for gear and supplies, with excess given back to the Church.
7. As the Church grows, it can help support and give missions.

## Dice System

Most rolls in the game are resolved by rolling a **d20**, applying your **Trait** bonus or penalty, and adding the die of the **Die Ranks**.

To resolve a roll:

**`d20 + Trait + DRs`**

### Die Ranks (DRs)

DRs represent upgraded die with a skill, training, gear, blessings, inspiration, and situational advantages.  
For the simplest version of the game:

- **1 DR → d4**  
- **2 DR → d6**  
- **3 DR → d8**  
- **4 DR → d10**  
- **5 DR → d12**

### Simple Game
In the simple game, characters are limited to **5 DR**, a single bonus die for any rolls. This caps any bonuses from skill, gear, blessings, situational bonuses. This helps simplify the game for both GMs and players. The GM should accordingly, keep NPCs and encounters at relatively low stats, especially armor saves! Start with easier challenges, i.e. poor bandits, feral vermin.

### The Dice Pool (Advanced)
Incorporating the advanced version should come after players and GMs understand the basic rolls for combat & encounters, how to use blessings and how to advance their character's skills and armor with Glory Points.
- **Explanation:** Dice Pools solves the common RPG issue of advanced characters becoming too powerful as they upgrade. As one gains more and more DRs, their bonus gets more diffused and costly. Yet there is still some advancement. And new players can join with veterans and still contribute.

Once a character accumulates more than 5 DR from skills, equipment, blessings, etc., these DRs form a **Dice Pool** of multiple dice:

1. For every **5 DR**, add one **d12** to the pool.  
2. If any DR remains (1–4), add one die based on the remainder:
   - **1 DR → d4**
   - **2 DR → d6**
   - **3 DR → d8**
   - **4 DR → d10**

Dice Pools are written like this:

**`{d12, d8}kh`** → roll all dice in the braces; **keep highest** (with special 7+ rule).

The acting player rolls all dice in their pool, but only the highest result gets added to the d20 total, unless modified by 7+ results (see below).


## Rolling the Dice

To make a check:

1. Roll **d20**.  
2. Roll your DR die or full Dice Pool.  
3. Identify the **single highest** die result.  
4. Add together:
   - d20 result  
   - Trait bonus or penalty  
   - Highest DR / Dice Pool result  
   - Any additional 7+ results  
5. Compare the total to the Difficulty.

### The 7+ Rule

Any die rolled in the Dice Pool that shows **7 or higher**:

- **Negates a natural 1** (fumble) on the d20.  
- **Adds to the total**, even if it is *not* the highest die in the dice pool.

### Summary of Dice System

-  **d20** plus a specific **Trait** bonus/penalty.
- **1–5 DR**: Basic single DR die (d4–d12).  
- **6+ DR**: Advanced **Dice Pool**.  
  - **Every 5 DR → d12**  
  - **Remainder DR → d4 / d6 / d8 / d10**  
- **Roll:** `d20 + Trait + {Dice Pool}kh`  
- **Any 7+ dice** also add to the total and negate Nat1.


## Difficulty
- Default Difficulty: **12**  
- Meet or exceed the Difficulty to succeed.

### Adjusting Difficulty
- **Opposed checks:** both sides roll; higher total wins. This is for evangelism, trade, persuasion, interrogation but also for grappling and blocking each other.  
- **Treacherous terrain:** GM rolls the character’s **Armor Save** to add to the Difficulty. This gives the sense of the armor's burden. Only apply the basic Armor Save versus if the character upgraded it with Glory Points. 
- **Extreme conditions:** GM may combine situational DRs (darkness, wet, mud, storm, under attack, etc...) to the **Armor Save** DR, then rolling. For easy play, no more than 5DRs total.
- **Explanation:** This gives both GM and players an easy way to understand the situation and lets the dice decide how hard it is.


## Combat
- **Surprise / Ambush:** Opponents make an Awareness roll-off. Use highest Awareness from each group. Winners may get first free attack. The GM may give the highest Armor Save DRs of each group, as a bonus, to the other group!
- **Faith Points** are rolled now, to be used for this encounter.  
- **Initiative Order:** loaded crossbows → ranged → spears → claws → light weapons → heavy weapons. May do an Awareness roll-off if similar. GM may use discretion.  
- **Turn Structure:** one **maneuver** + one **action**, or two maneuvers.  
- **Actions include:** melee attack, ranged attack, aid, blessings.
- **Manuevers include:** reloading, moving, using the special rule for DRR action rolls like dodge or parry.
- **Free Actions:** speech, drawing weapons, invoking a helpful blessing.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** that adversely affect a target are in the ranged initiative order.
- **Magic, Curses or Blessings** of any sort, may only be used once per turn.

### Damage
- **Weapons** deal damage from **d4 to d12**, depending on size and type. In advanced play, these may go beyond 5DRs.
- **Vitality (PCs)** and **Vigor (NPCs)** number decreases when damage is taken. Think of these as exhaustion, cuts & bruise, but not grievous wounds.
- **Armor Save:** roll armor to reduce incoming damage. A mininum of 1 damage if the weapon die is higher than the armor save DR.
- A character at **0 Vitality or Less** is out and triggers the **Life Saves** rules.
- A villain at **0 Vigor or Less** is deceased. If missionaries want to save them, at GMs descrition, and great healing rolls, they may.

### Healing, Vitality
- **Short Rest:** recover **Prowess or Spirit + d4**.  
- **Full Rest:** restore all Vitality.

### Criticals & Fumbles
- **Nat20:** automatic success, **double damage**, and **Grievous Wounds rule** applies, if advanced rules used.  
- **Nat1:** consult the fumble table (e.g., strike an ally, stumble, drop or damage gear).  
- **Avoiding Fumbles:** higher DR values help reduce the likelihood of suffering a catastrophic outcome, the 7+ Rule.

#### Nat1 Fumble Chart

When a player rolls a **Natural 1** on a d20 attack roll, roll **1d6** on this table:

| d6 | Fumble Result |
|----|---------------|
| 1  | **Hit an ally!** Roll weapon damage as normal; they may apply their Armor Save. If there, otherwise, do #2. |
| 2  | **Hit yourself.** Roll your own weapon damage and apply Armor Save. |
| 3  | **Fall prone.** Must use next manuever to get up, take **d4 damage** with no Armor Save. |
| 4  | **Self-stagger.** You stumble fiercly about, take **d4 damage** with no Armor Save). |
| 5  | **Weapon damaged.** Your weapon is damaged. Reduce it by one DR of damage.|
| 6  | **Item damaged.** If ranged, mark ammo as low, then depleted. If shield is in use mark as damaged, then destroyed. Or randomly pick a gear. Returning to town can replenish or repair.|

### Life Saves & Conditions

When a character’s **Vitality is 0 or less**, they must make **Life Saves** each turn until stabilized or dead.

**Life Save Roll:**  
`d20 + Prowess or Spirit`  
**Difficulty:** 12
- + Grievous Wound DR if Advanced play.

- **Success:** Recover **+d4 Vitality**.  
- **Failure:** Lose **−d6 Vitality**.

A character dies when their Vitality reaches the **negative of their maximum Vitality**.

Life Saves continue each turn until the character stabilizes, recovers above 0 Vitality, or dies.

This represents the struggle to stay alive in the face of grievous injury or shock — requiring both physical resolve and spiritual fortitude.

## Skill Examples

Below are examples of common skill uses, the Traits they rely on, and whether the roll is against **Difficulty 12** or a **roll-off** against an NPC or creature. These denote possible skills and upgrading them. Players can come up with any skill, with GM's approval on scope & usage. The default 12 denotes quick easy gameplay but can be changed by GM due to the challenge.

### Prowess
- Climbing walls, cliffs, or trees — vs 12 + Armor Save  
- Jumping, tumbling, or leaping gaps — vs 12 + Armor Save 
- Grappling or shoving an opponent — roll-off  
- Dodging thrown objects — roll-off
- Strength tests — vs 12
  
### Awareness
- Spotting hidden objects or basic clues — vs 12  
- Noticing danger, traps, or ambush — vs 12  
- Tracking someone in mud or snow — vs 12  
- Listening through a door — vs 12
- Sneaking, hiding against others — roll off, Armor Saves may be used? 

### Savvy
- Repairing tools, weapons, or armor — vs 12 + DR damage (optional)  
- Identifying herbs, ailments, or dangerous flora — vs 12  
- Navigating a ruined site or dungeon per small area — vs 12

### Society
(Most Society tasks are **roll-offs**, as they involve people.)
- Persuading a stubborn villager — roll-off  
- Performance, storytelling, entertain — roll-off  
- Negotiating with merchants or lords — roll-off  
- Reading a crowd’s mood — vs 12
- Understanding a social situation - vs 12
- Perceiving skullduggery - vs 12 or roll-off  

These examples show how Traits map to skills and give the GM easy targets to call upon during play.

---

## Situational DR Modifiers

The GM may add **+1 DR** for each element making the task more difficult. For the simple game, the max is 5DRs and the GM should average it out to about 3DR if called for. Describing each major DR factor, the GM then rolls the corresponding die infront of players and adds it to the difficulty. This will include the armor save, again to a max of 5DRs for beginning game.

Here is a list of colorful examples a GM may describe:

muddy, wet, stormy, icy, windy, dark, dim-lit, smoky, foggy, swaying, crowded, noisy, echoing, slippery, sweaty, cold, freezing, burning hot, feverish, thorny, tangled, cramped, narrow, uneven, unstable, debris-strewn, cluttered, haunted-feeling, blood-stained, nauseating, smelly, foul, dizzying, panicked, rushed, time-pressured, hungry, thirsty, exhausted, shivering, blinded by sun, half-blind from smoke, disoriented, intimidated, overwhelmed, encumbered, carrying someone, startled, distracted, frightened, desperate, dripping wet, ankle-deep water, knee-deep mud, waist-deep snow, insects swarming, wolves howling, bells ringing, torches sputtering, arrows whistling past, armor rattling, horse bucking, shield slipping, cloak snagging on brambles.

This list is not exhaustive — it exists to inspire rich descriptions of tense, gritty challenges.

## Advanced Play

This can be introduced after GMs and players get the hang of combat, rolling skills, blessings, roleplaying and upgrading with Glory Points. If a long campaign is desired.

- [Special Rules](#special-rules)

---

## Die Rank Results (DRR)
- On success: (Total − Difficulty) ÷ 2 = **DRR bonus**.  
- On failure: (Difficulty − Total) ÷ 2 = **DRR penalty**.  
- DRR may be applied immediately to healing, repairs, treasure, aid, or penalties like damage or gear wear.  
- **Explanation:** GM can ignore this or use to help define the results of a roll.

---

## Penalty Dice

Players and NPCs can gain **Penalty Dice** as -DRs for various reasons.  
They **do not** apply these penalties directly to their rolls.

Instead, the **GM applies Penalty Dice** to major factors like:

- **Difficulty** (making a task harder)  
- **Defense** (making a target harder to hit)

The GM rolls it separately and adds it to opposing rolls, defenses, or difficulties.

The penalty DR is applied to **only one factor per turn**.  
The GM may also forget or forgo using them.

### Sources of Penalty  Dice  
The following examples combine to form a character’s total **Penalty Dice**:

- Temporary pains & stuns (not fatal)  
- Temporary frustrations, failed rolls (not fatal)  
- Curses, fear  
- Blurred or blind vision  
- Minor afflictions (nausea, stings, rashes)
- Over burdened.
**Below are Fatal if beyond 5DRs**  
- Grievous Wounds  
- Afflictions such as **poison, disease, sickness**

## Afflictions

Poison, disease, and similar conditions are treated as **Grievous Wounds**.  
If an Affliction’s DR penalty becomes **worse than 5 DR**, it is **fatal**. There is no Life Save.

Afflictions are gained from:
- Failing disease or poison rolls.  
- Prolonged exposure to harsh environments.  
- Curses or spiritual attacks (GM discretion).  
- Failing specific encounter hazards.

**Recovery:**  
Afflictions can be removed through:

- Time and rest,  
- Medical care,  
- Herbal treatments,  
- Prayer or blessings,  
- Completing certain quests.

The GM determines the steps and difficulty of recovery.

## Grievous Wounds

A **Grievous Wound** represents severe bodily harm. These wounds occur when:

- A character is struck by a **Nat20** attack in combat, or  
- A situation involves extreme failure or massive harm (GM discretion).

### Grievous Wound Calculation (Nat20 Attacks)

1. Roll **double weapon damage**.  
2. Apply the target’s **Armor Save** to reduce the damage.  
3. Any damage that gets through:
   - Reduces **Vitality/Vigor** as normal, and  
   - Is used to determine the wound’s severity:  
     **Half of the damage taken = the Grievous Wound’s Penalty Dice.**

This DR penalty represents the wound’s seriousness.

### Shifting the Wound to Armor

After determining the wound’s DR penalty, the target may:

- Move some or all of the **wound DR** onto their **armor’s DR** instead.
- This reduces the armor by that many DRs.
- If doing so reduces armor to **0 DR**, the armor is **destroyed**.
- A character may also **sacrifice a shield or great helm** to completely cancel the Grievous Wound from that attack.

### Effects of Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds impose -DR **Penalty Dice** that affects:

- Life Save rolls when at 0 Vitality
- Penalties to one roll per turn. The GM picks one, rolls the Grievous Wound DR and adds it to the difficulty of that roll. He can choose other options, but only one per turn against the grievously wounded. He may forget or forgo it. The player never has to deal with the penalty in determining their own rolls.

These wounds persist until treated through appropriate care, skills, or blessings. Healing such are noted in the skills, Miracle of Healing and DRR rules.


### Healing Grievous Wounds

Grievous Wounds require intentional healing. They do not recover through normal Vitality rest.

The Difficulty to heal a Grievous Wound is:

**Difficulty = 12 + Grievous Wound DR**

A healing attempt produces a **DRR**. Any DR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.

#### Order of Healing (Per Day)

1. **Miracle of Healing** (Nun / Blessed)  
2. **Healer or Surgeon**  
3. **Nightly Rest Healing** (required)

Each step may reduce the wound’s DR through DRR.

##### Miracle of Healing (Blessing)

The Nun or Blessed character acts **first** because her miracle is the safest method.

For the Miracle of Healing:

- The nun adds **Faith Points as DRs** directly into her Dice Pool.  
- She may add **any of her own healing-related skills** (Healing, Surgery, Mothering, Herbalism, etc.) as additional DRs.  
- She rolls **Spirit + {Dice Pool}kh** against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- Any DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- **Failure never worsens the wound.**  
- May be used **once per day**.

This represents divine aid working through her skills and devotion.

##### Healing Through Skills (Healer or Surgeon)

After the Nun’s attempt (if any), a healer may treat the wound:

- Add **Trait + Healing/Surgery skills** and any situational DRs.  
- Roll against **12 + Wound DR**.  
- DRR above the Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
- A disastrous failure may worsen the wound.

May be attempted **once per day**.

##### Rest Healing (Nightly Required Roll)

Every full night of rest, the wounded character must roll:

**Prowess or Spirit + {any chosen DRs}kh vs (12 + Wound DR)**

##### The Pain Rule (Special)

If the patient chooses to add **any** of their own DRs  
(e.g., Medical knowledge, Blessings, Inspired Die, Hope DR, etc.):

- The GM must roll the **Wound DR as a penalty die** (representing pain, trembling, shock).  
- The result of this penalty die is **added to the Difficulty** for that night.

This makes self-healing risky but potentially rewarding.

A DRR above the final Difficulty reduces the wound’s DR.  
Failure or very low DRR may worsen the wound (GM discretion).

The Rest Healing roll is **mandatory** until the wound is fully healed.


##### Resolving Complete Healing

When the Wound DR reaches **0**, the Grievous Wound is healed.

Vitality may then recover normally.

---

## Special Rules

### Grappling (Simple Version)

- A grapple is a struggle between two combatants in close combat.
- To attempt a grapple, the attacker and defender each roll:
  `d20 + Awarenes and/or Weapon/Grappling Skill` to escape or grapple.
- Compare results:
  - The **higher total wins** the grapple struggle.
  - Subtract the lesser roll from the greater; **halve** the difference.
  - The winner may split that DR between:
    - **Vitality drain** (minor injury) and/or  
    - **Penalties** to the target’s future rolls.
    - **Escaping** bonus to move away, defense or counter strike.
- If the defender wins a roll, they **escape** the grapple and negate its effects.
- Each turn, both sides roll opposed grappling again, carrying over prior penalties or bonuses.
  
### Point Blank & Ambush

- Point Blank applies only at **melee range** against a target that is:
  - **Unaware**,  
  - **Not moving**, and  
  - Within reach of the attacker.

- With **handheld guns or daggers**, the **first** Point Blank attack:
  - **Hits on anything except a Nat1**  
  - Is treated as a **Nat20 hit**  
  - **Ignores Armor Saves**  
  - May target a **specific limb or location**

- **Other melee weapons** cannot gain the Point Blank Nat20 effect, but:
  - Still hit on anything except **Nat1**  
  - Do **not** ignore armor  
  - Inflict a **−1 DR wound** on a successful hit

- **Grappling** at Point Blank:
  - Hits on anything except **Nat1**  
  - Gains **+2 DR** to the attempt  
  - Can still be resisted normally

### Afflictions

**Poison, disease, sickness.**  
These are part of **Grievous Wounds**.  
Beyond **–5 DR** is fatal.

---

### Bleed #

“#” equals the amount of damage required to trigger Bleed.

- Take **1 damage per round**.  
- Bleed **can be cumulative**.  
- **Save 12** with healing skills; 1 turn stops **1 Bleed**.  
- **Heal Blessing** removes **1 Bleed per 1 DR** spent.

- At **0 Vitality**, **Life Saves are not necessary**.

**Causes:**  
- Strain, accidents, over-exertion  
- Not caused by violent attacks  

**Recovery:**  
- Requires **recovery time**, shaking it off, or minor first aid.

**Note:**  
Exhaustion is **not** part of Grievous Wounds or Afflictions for healing or dying,  
but its **DR penalties are added** to any penalty rolls.

---

### Falling

- **+1 DR damage per 10 feet** fallen.  
- A fall is a **critical**, dealing **double damage** with possible **Grievous Wound**.  
- Character **may roll Armor Save** to reduce damage.

---

### Fear  
*(See Shocks above)*

- Gives **penalty DRs** to rolls.  
- Beyond **–5 DR** results in **paralyzing fear**.

- All gear, weapons, armor are categorzied into the three areas.
- Players can only carry the amount of each category withou a DR penalty.
- Backpacks, sacks, belts with scabbards can increase it.
- Overburden = -1DR or Armor Save DR penalty.
- Donkey + cart can carry heavy loads but are not immediately accessible, free for the Patron Lady.
- **Wear & Tear:** Nat1 can add low to ammo or damaged to gear. Next would be depleted or destroyed. 
- **Repair:** Difficulty = 12, a success repairs depleted or damaged. Must have time & tools.
- **Repair Armor:** Difficulty = 12, a success repairs one DR of damage. Must have time & tools.
- **Time & Tools:** time would be one repair per long rest, specific tool kits for the category.

## Power of Faith — Quick Rules

Faith Points fuel blessings and miracles.

- Characters have **Faith for Each Encounter** and **Faith for the Day**.
- • Faith for Each Encounter — used during combat, danger, spiritual conflict, or moments of tension. This pool refreshes between encounters.
- • Faith for the Day — used during calm scenes, travel, roleplay, teaching, preaching, or preparation. This pool is more limited and not meant for repeated use in high danger.
- Faith Points are spent when invoking a blessing.
- Each Faith Point spent becomes **Die Ranks (DR)**.

**Deliverance is always required.**  
Deliverance determines **how strong** the blessing is. Faith Points spent on Deliverance convert directly into DRs that define the blessing’s effect.

Additional Faith Points may be spent to shape the blessing:

- **Deluge** — how many targets are affected  
- **Duration** — how long the blessing lasts  
- **Duress** — how hard the blessing is to resist  
- **Distance** — how far away the target is  

Blessings aiding allies are usually **free actions**.  
Blessings used against opposition usually require an **action**.

# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.
- Success = establishing a church; then GM introduces the next mission.
- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.

# Creatures & Beasts

## General Notes
- Beasts and foes represent pagan threats, wild animals, or mythic adversaries.
- Each has Traits, Defense, Armor Save, and Vigor (vitality).
- Many can be converted or calmed through Spirit, preaching, or compassion.
- GM discretion: some foes resist conversion unless gravely wounded or shown mercy.

## Example Creature: Old Gladiator
- **Name**: Athgunert, former gladiator
- **Traits**: Pro5, Awa4, Sav-1, Spi2, Int0, Soc3
- **Defense**: 19 + shield + helm
- **Armor Save**: d6 (leathers)
- **Vigor**: 22
- **Weapons**: Gladius +5 +1DR, d10 damage, bleed6, parry+2
- **Skills**: Parry+7 +3DR
- **Conversion**: Only if gravely wounded, healed, and shown compassion. May later guard a church.

---

# Catacombs & Crypts

## Traps & Hazards
- **Detection**: Awareness/Savvy 12 to notice traps; Savvy/Intellect 12 to disarm.
- **Avoidance**: Prowess/Awareness/Savvy 12 to leap, duck, or evade.
- **Failure**: 1DR damage + possible grievous wound after armor save.
- **Poison/Disease**: Pro/Spi 12 to resist; may foul armor if transferred.

### Common Traps
- Tunnel descent: DRs add difficulty; failures drain vitality, damage gear, or cause wounds.
- Wells/Pits: may contain vermin, spirits, or treasure; climbing difficulty 12.
- Chasms: Awareness 12 to spot; failure = fall + Pro save.
- Pit traps: Awareness 12 to spot; Savvy 12 to disarm; falling = d6+d6 damage.
- Deadfall traps: Awareness 12 + DRs to avoid; falling rocks = d6–d12 damage.
- Collapsing floors/ceilings: same mechanics as deadfall.

---

## Altars, Shrines, Tombs
- Fires: pagan sacrifices, distractions, or rituals.
- Tombs: pagan or Christian; may contain relics, traps, or curses.
