## Traits
Traits are a constant number, from -2 to +4 usually. It could go higher but there are special rules for that. Players start off having to allocate -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3 into the six traits. When a player does anything, with a roll, the GM and player decide on a trait to add to the roll.
-Prowess: like strength in other TTRPGS but more apt about how one uses their strenght and physicality than about bulk muscle, melee, atheltic, physical and also resistance against pain and suffering
-Awareness: like dexterity in other TTRPGs, but more apt. For dodging, avoiding, noticing, perception, searching... Less about physical agility and more about how one is quickly able to react to situations, have situational awareness.
