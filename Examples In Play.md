## Dice System

### Stealth Success
### Example: Brother Thomas Attempts Stealth

Brother Thomas, a Scout, tries to sneak past pagan guards at night.

- Trait: Awareness +3
- Total Die Ranks (DR): 7 (from Stealth skill, gear, and situational bonuses)

**Step 1: Build the Dice Pool**
- 7 DR converts to {d12, d6}.
- Roll both dice and keep the highest.

**Step 2: Make the Roll**
- Roll d20 → 11
- Add Trait (+3) → 14
- Roll Dice Pool {d12=9, d6=4} → keep highest = 9
- Total = 14 + 9 = 23

**Step 3: Compare to Difficulty**
- Standard Difficulty = 12
- 23 vs 12 → Success

**Step 4: Calculate Die Rank Result (DRR)**
- (23 − 12) ÷ 2 = 5 DRR

**GM Narrative Payoff**
The GM rules that Brother Thomas’s success grants a **+5 DRR bonus** to the *next related action*.  
- If Thomas launches a surprise attack, he adds +5 DRR to that strike.  
- If another missionary sneaks immediately after him, they gain +5 DRR to their stealth roll.  
- The bonus applies only in this moment, not stored for later.


### Stealth Failure
### Example: Sister Miriam Attempts a Climb

Sister Miriam, a Clergy, tries to climb the crumbling wall of a pagan fortress.

- Trait: **Prowess +2**
- Die Ranks (DR) Breakdown:
  - Climbing skill = +2 DR
  - Vines growing on the wall (environmental aid) = +2 DR
  - Inspired Die (personal devotion) = +1 DR
  - Brother Thomas blesses her = +1 DR
- **Total DR = 6**

**Step 1: Gather the Dice**
One player collects all dice for the check — the **d20** and the **pool dice** derived from 6 DR.  
6 DR converts to {d12, d4}.  
All dice are rolled together in a single throw. The d20 result is noted first, then the highest die from the pool is identified.

**Step 2: Make the Roll (procedural)**
- Rolled dice: d20 + {d12, d4}
- Results: d20 = 6; pool dice = d12 = 3, d4 = 2
- Keep highest pool die: 3
- Add Trait: +2
- Total = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**

**Step 3: Determine Difficulty**
- The GM judges the wall as difficult terrain.  
- Difficulty is base 12 plus the character’s Armor Save.  
- Sister Miriam has no armor, so **no Armor Save is added**.  
- Final Difficulty = **12**  
- Result: 11 vs 12 → **Failure**

**Step 4: Calculate DRR (minimum 1DR)**
- Failure margin: \((12 − 11) ÷ 2 = 0.5\) → round up to **−1 DR penalty** (minimum 1DR).  
- On success, the same calculation would yield a **+1 DRR bonus** (minimum 1DR).  
- The GM may interpret the −1DR as either:
  - A penalty applied to the next related action, or  
  - Damage taken: roll a **d4** and apply that to Sister Miriam’s vitality.

**GM Narrative Payoff**
The GM rules that Sister Miriam’s slip imposes a **−1 DR penalty** on the next climb attempt.  
Alternatively, the GM may narrate that she scrapes her hands and suffers **d4 damage**.  
The effect is immediate and applies only in this moment.

**Outcome**
Sister Miriam falters against the mossy wall, leaving her allies with a tougher climb — and possibly suffering a minor injury.
