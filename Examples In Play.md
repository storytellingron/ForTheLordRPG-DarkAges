## Dice System

### Stealth Success
### Example: Brother Thomas Attempts Stealth

Brother Thomas, a Scout, tries to sneak past pagan guards at night.

- Trait: **Awareness +3**
- Die Ranks (DR) Breakdown:
  - Stealth skill = +3 DR
  - Nighttime shadows (environmental aid) = +2 DR
  - Inspired Die (personal devotion) = +1 DR
  - Scout’s light gear = +1 DR
- **Total DR = 7**

**Step 1: Gather the Dice**
One player collects all dice for the check — the **d20** and the **pool dice** derived from 7 DR.  
7 DR converts to {d12, d6}.  
All dice are rolled together in a single throw. The d20 result is noted first, then the highest die from the pool is identified.

**Step 2: Make the Roll (procedural)**
- Rolled dice: d20 + {d12, d6}  
- Results: d20 = 11; pool dice = d12 = 9, d6 = 4  
- Keep highest pool die: 9  
- Add Trait: +3  
- Total = 11 + 9 + 3 = **23**

**Step 3: Determine Difficulty**
- The GM sets the base Difficulty at **12** for a standard stealth attempt.  
- No Armor Save is added (stealth checks don’t involve armor burden here).  
- Result: 23 vs 12 → **Success**

**Step 4: Calculate DRR (minimum 1DR)**
- Success margin: \((23 − 12) ÷ 2 = 5.5\) → round down to **5 DRR**  
- Minimum rule doesn’t apply here since the margin is already greater than 1.  
- On a narrower success (e.g., total 13 vs 12), the calculation would yield **+1 DRR** (minimum 1DR).

**GM Narrative Payoff (immediate, GM‑directed)**
The GM rules that Brother Thomas’s success grants a **+5 DRR bonus** to the *next related action*.  
- If Thomas launches a surprise attack, he adds +5 DRR to that strike.  
- If another missionary sneaks immediately after him, they gain +5 DRR to their stealth roll.  
- The bonus applies only in this moment, not stored for later.

**Outcome**
Brother Thomas slips past the guards unseen, his success granting a strong advantage to the next missionary action.


### Stealth Failure
### Example: Sister Miriam Attempts a Climb

Sister Miriam, a Clergy, tries to climb the crumbling wall of a pagan fortress.

- Trait: **Prowess +2**
- Die Ranks (DR) Breakdown:
  - Climbing skill = +2 DR
  - Vines growing on the wall (environmental aid) = +2 DR
  - Inspired Die (personal devotion) = +1 DR
  - Brother Thomas blesses her = +1 DR
- **Total DR = 6**

**Step 1: Gather the Dice**
One player collects all dice for the check — the **d20** and the **pool dice** derived from 6 DR.  
6 DR converts to {d12, d4}.  
All dice are rolled together in a single throw. The d20 result is noted first, then the highest die from the pool is identified.

**Step 2: Make the Roll (procedural)**
- Rolled dice: d20 + {d12, d4}
- Results: d20 = 6; pool dice = d12 = 3, d4 = 2
- Keep highest pool die: 3
- Add Trait: +2
- Total = 6 + 3 + 2 = **11**

**Step 3: Determine Difficulty**
- The GM judges the wall as difficult terrain.  
- Difficulty is base 12 plus the character’s Armor Save.  
- Sister Miriam has no armor, so **no Armor Save is added**.  
- Final Difficulty = **12**  
- Result: 11 vs 12 → **Failure**

**Step 4: Calculate DRR (minimum 1DR)**
- Failure margin: \((12 − 11) ÷ 2 = 0.5\) → round up to **−1 DR penalty** (minimum 1DR).  
- On success, the same calculation would yield a **+1 DRR bonus** (minimum 1DR).  
- The GM may interpret the −1DR as either:
  - A penalty applied to the next related action, or  
  - Damage taken: roll a **d4** and apply that to Sister Miriam’s vitality.

**GM Narrative Payoff**
The GM rules that Sister Miriam’s slip imposes a **−1 DR penalty** on the next climb attempt.  
Alternatively, the GM may narrate that she scrapes her hands and suffers **d4 damage**.  
The effect is immediate and applies only in this moment.

**Outcome**
Sister Miriam falters against the mossy wall, leaving her allies with a tougher climb — and possibly suffering a minor injury.
