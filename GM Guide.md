# GM Guidelines

## Role of the Grande Minister (GM)
- Sets up maps with locations (villages, groves, crypts, pagan sites).
- Prepares NPCs with simple goals and beliefs.
- Describes scenes as players explore; only reveal what characters perceive.
- Improvises NPC actions based on conversion levels, hostility, or openness.

## Missions
- Each mission centers on evangelism, fellowship, and church planting.
- Success = establishing a church; then GM introduces the next mission.
- Missions should balance teaching, morality, and fun — light, heroic, and collaborative.

## NPCs
- NPCs have conversion levels (ripe, resistant, hostile).
- Pagan foes may use curses, alchemy, or demonic influences.
- Some NPCs can be converted through compassion, healing, or preaching.

## Encounters
- GM sets Difficulty numbers (default 12).
- Combat: Defense = 12 + Awareness + gear bonuses.
- Armor Save reduces damage; treacherous terrain adds penalties.
- Surprise/Ambush resolved by Awareness roll‑offs.

## Storytelling Style
- Keep narration succinct; players should speak more than GM.
- Encourage roleplay, creativity, and descriptive actions.
- Avoid interrupting player roleplay unless acting as antagonists.
- Fellowship and humor are encouraged; brevity keeps pacing strong.

# Creatures & Beasts

## General Notes
- Beasts and foes represent pagan threats, wild animals, or mythic adversaries.
- Each has Traits, Defense, Armor Save, and Vigor (vitality).
- Many can be converted or calmed through Spirit, preaching, or compassion.
- GM discretion: some foes resist conversion unless gravely wounded or shown mercy.

## NPC & Creature Stat Block Format

Non-player characters, creatures, and animals use a compact, line-based stat block. 
Each line has a specific purpose and is always presented in the same order.

**Line 1 — Name or Role**  
The creature’s name, title, or narrative role.

**Line 2 — Core Traits**  
A comma-separated list of abbreviated Traits with modifiers.
- Pro (Prowess), Awa (Awareness), Sav (Savvy), Spi (Spirit), Int (Intellect), Soc (Society)
- Modifiers may be positive or negative. Usually -2 to +4. 5+ exceptions are possible with Prowess for more brutish, giant beasts.

**Line 3 — Defense & Survival**  
Lists core defensive values and durability.
- Defense (Def) See Armor Rules
- Armor type (descriptive of Def bonus and body armor)
- Armor Save (Save) See Armor Rules
- Vigor (NPC vitality) See Glory Points vitality rules

**Line 4+ — Attacks**  
Each attack is listed on its own line, prefixed with a dash (`-`).
- Attack Name
- To-Hit (Trait+DR) bonus
- Damage die or dice
- Special rules or conditions

**Line 5+ — Abilities & Traits**  
A comma-separated list of aware and/or interactive skills with their appropriate Trait & DR bonus.
A conversion rating could be alotted and summarized here.

**Line 6 - Magic**
**Magic Points Trait+DRs**
**Magic or Curse list**, simple summary of each.
Could add typical magic point expenditures as preset attacks and defenses.
