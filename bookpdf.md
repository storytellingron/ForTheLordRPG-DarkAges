A Role-playing Game
	In the Era of the Early Church	


Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the schemes of the Devil. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
Ephesians 6:11-12

Fellow Brothers & Sisters!
The Church survives the quarrels of the Lombards, the Romans, the Byzantium leaders! We are on the march, into the fray, northward into the mountains and forests! There, many legions of pagan Rome have fallen, and yet we go! We are sent by God! To spread the Church of Jesus Christ! We are sent with love and truth. Many there suffer the tyranny of the demonic despots. We are coming to liberate them from such dark forces! Have faith! Have truth! Have justice! For the path is dark and narrow, wrought with schemes and ambush, wrought with the barbarians and the sin of men.
Have faith! Have truth! Have justice! For the Lord is with thee! These pagans are left to their own wanton religions, but we are The Church. We are to show them the Truth or die trying. Some are ready, their souls hunger for the Truth. Seek them out! But others, God has darkened, and their souls are ready to fight back. Defend oneself! Be ready, for the sword is carried with great reserve. Be as cunning as the serpent but as pure as the dove! Follow Christ, but know you are men!
Brothers & Sisters... Children of God, go forth into the darkness with our Light. Go forth and spread the good news and establish the Church. For it is the greatest of deeds that you lay your life down for your fellow men. I bless you. I am praying for you. I am relying on you! In the name of Our Father, the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ! Amen.
~Bishop Onesimus the VIth

	BASICCONCEPTS	
What is a Christian role-playing game or RPG?	
First, an RPG is a type of game. It is neutral concerning its setting. An RPG can be ‘Running the Church RPG’ or ‘Evangelizing in a Futuristic World’. There are a myriad of secular or pagan games out there like Dungeons & Dragons and Star Wars RPG.
The basic premise is players get to explore an area and interact with non-player characters that a game master (GM) prepares ahead of time. The players discover locations and interact with locals as the GM describes the scene and acts out any encounters.
The players have characters or missionaries like a warrior who uses their prowess and fighting, a cleric who uses their spirit to preach and convert, a nun who uses her spirit to heal and aid or a patron lady of the church who uses her funding and social skills to further the church’s needs. Each has strengths and weaknesses depicted as numbers added to dice rolls and can be customized with different skills and gear.
The players describe what they do based on their characters’ designated abilities, roleplaying as much as possible. The GM decides when characters roll dice adding their skill numbers to succeed or fail at a trial number determined by the GM. It could be climbing a cliff to tricking a guard or fighting a foe. The number to roll varies based on the rules and challenges.
At the end of each session, if they survive, there is usually rewards in the form of treasure found and experience gained. Treasure helps the characters afford better gear. Experience helps the players ‘buy’ upgrades for their skills and dice rolls.
As the characters get stronger, the GM makes the setting, story and encounters more difficult and more epic.


The Old Gladiator	
A lone gladiator travels the roads. He is raving mad and hates that Christians have thwarted many gladiatorial arenas where once he was famous. If he recognizes the group as Christians he will immediately threaten them. He is willing to take them all on to prove their God and beliefs are a lie. He believes the only glory should go to great fighters who have killed many, including weak Christians, for the entertainment of all the gods & for the glory of Rome!
If he is defeated yet not killed, he could be saved. If so, he could ‘show up’ later to rescue them.
He will not convert unless he is gravely wounded & defeated, then healed and shown compassion. He has never known compassion.

StorytellingRon, the Game Designer, is a Christian.
What kind of a Christian?
I am a Christian, Creation, Calvinist conservative curmudgeon! I go to Grace Community Church under Pastor John MacArthur. I became a Christian around 40 years of age. In my early years I was Catholic but became an atheist fool with a very disjointed view of compassion.
I certainly want to be Biblical in what I do, but have some old fun silly miscreant ways as well. This role playing game is not meant to be a theological treatise on the Bible or Christian history. It’s meant to be fun and replace those secular games that draw our kids & adults from the habits of our faith and toward pagan ones. I hope it helps in fellowship and hones one’s understanding of missionary work, edifying us all on evangelism and church planting.
This game is meant for any Christian, Catholic or Orthodox professing Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. This is also strongly adhering to a traditional view on marriage, family values and other conservative tenets.
This is meant for fellowship, edification, collaborative storytelling and fun. GMs should make missions that have some element of teaching, morality and lessons, but nothing too heavy or preachy. Keep it light, fun, heroic and silly. Just as God rested from his work, so should we.
 
	generalsetting	

Level of fantasy, intensity	

The setting is an amalgam of history, myth & folklore of early medieval Europe. Much of what is discerned mixes reality with some elements of fantasy that have roots in history.
There is magic, done by dark forces. They will use curses and afflictions to hold on to power. There is blessings and miracles done by Christians.
Pagan foes that adhere to their beliefs will be mean and use alchemy and some demonic influences to exact their tyranny on the local populace. Some pagans will be ready to hear the Gospel and ripe for conversion.
There is an attempt to adhere to Biblical theology but also historical claims made by early Church and medieval historians of the Dark Ages. So a lot of what Christians can do or believe in this game may not be Biblically accurate yet their heart is in the right place. And this is true for all who are truly, truly striving for God’s Will.
‘Conversion’ in this game doesn’t necessarily mean the person is fully Christian and saved. It refers to the conversion of people enough that they will accept a transition to Christian ethics and establishing a church. Missionaries will need to use the Gospel message to break down animosity to Christianity in the game for the purpose of planting churches. Once a church is established, the missionaries have succeeded and can upgrade their skills and gear. Then the GM, through storytelling, shall introduce the next mission he or she has prepared.





	The Lombards of Germany occupying Northern Italy	



It is now the Kingdom of the Lombards. The king is elected by the highest ranking aristocrats and dukes. The kingdom is subdivided into duchies. Due to the sparse population, history of plagues and devastations after the fall of Rome, most areas are isolated and self ruling. The dukes in each area seek self governance when it comes to political matters. While the Lombards are known to have Christian influences, the sparse populations are more pagan and secretive. Each vies to control the duke or region.
The king and aristocracy in the larger cities such as Milan and Pavia are mixed with Goths and Romans, most concerned with their borders. To the south, the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantiums are vying for all of Italy. To the north, many barbarian kingdoms penetrate deep into the mountains, valleys and dark forests. On the coasts, pirates from all manner of pagan nations hunt the riches and relics of churches and villages that are prospering under this new Christendom. The game is meant to be light on history yet edify us on missionary work and how it may have transpired in the past using an amalgam or mix of medieval historical icons, myths, folklore and legends. The stance concerning the early Church for this game is that it is open to Protestants, Catholics and Orthodox. The game focuses on planting churches and not doctrine, legalism or Church history. The full Bible wasn’t available nor readable to all but a few within the established
clergy of the time.
 
	Role-playinggame(rPg)	
  The Grande Minister or Game Master (GM)	


One person plays the GM. This person sets up a map with locations like a village, a grove, a crypt, a pagan ritual spot. The GM notes non-player characters or NPCs in them like a blacksmith, villagers, a witch, bandits and dangerous beasts.
The GM determines what each NPCs is doing, what their goals and beliefs are. There is a conversion level table in here, the GMs can roll on. Their goals should be simple enough that when encountered, improvisation can occur by the GM for each NPC.
The GM describes the scene to the players as they explore, what they see before them. It is best not to give the players information the actual characters themselves do not see or inquire about.
There is a lot of info & rules in this book to guide the GM and give them motivations and plots for the setting and how to play out confrontations & combat.



	Missionary, Saint	

Others play as missionaries or saints. These are characters the players portray in the above setting the GM has laid out.
The players note their character on a character sheet with inherent Traits, skill upgrades, what kind of gear they are using. For the clergy, they should be familiar with Blessings and basic use of Faith Points.
All of these things, done in personalized ways, can make for unique characters.

	Traits, skills, gear	
To determine how a player’s character will succeed in the game, whether maneuvering, combat, preaching, talking, searching around, one needs to have rules and game mechanics.
The GM will set up difficulties that are assigned numbers. The rules explain how to get these numbers. Players roll dice and add their character’s traits, skills and use of gear to match or beat these numbers.
The essential RPG mechanic of rolling dice to beat these difficult numbers creates a tense and fun story time where everyone is involved in how the story plays out.
The GM sets the scenario, like putting toys in a sandbox. He sets up how things will get resolved with difficulty numbers.
The players explore the sandbox, knowing they have their own bonus numbers as traits, skills & gear. They know with dice rolling, there is an element of randomness and possible failures. This tension is what helps build an exciting story.


	Fellowship to ministry	
This book and the rules are a guide. They are not meant to be controlling or constricting, but a form of agreed upon set of parameters so all know how to play this particular game. There should be wiggle room for using the rules, changing them to suit the group, disregarding some, adding nifty new ones.
This game is Christian and is meant to have fun but also to return us to the habit of evangelism & church planting. It is meant to create a fellowship of men & women, boys & girls. And if that all goes well, turn it into a ministry in the community.




 
	gamedice	
	The Dice	
The dice used are the large twenty-sided die known as d20. And the 5 smaller dice as the four-sided die (d4), six-sided die (d6), eight-sided die (d8), ten-sided die (d10) and the twelve-sided die (d12).
The d20 is the main dice used for all skill rolls including combat.
The group of 5 dice represent any bonuses gained through skills and blessings and so on. These are the Die Ranks: 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8, 4=d10, 5=d12
Every 5th DR garners a d12.

	Die Ranks	

Skills, blessings, inspired die, gear and other factors are added together as Die Ranks.
If the Die Rank total is 1 through 5, then the bonus die is 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8, 4=d10 or 5=d12.
If the sum is 6 or more, factors of 5 are used with a possible remainder of 1 through 4. This is then a Dice Pool.


	Dice Pool	

When one gets a lot of bonus Die Ranks, they group the numbers in factors of 5. So every 5 Die Ranks has a d12! Any remaining number between 1-4 will get that corresponding smaller die: 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8 or 4=d10
This will form the Dice Pool. When rolling, one keeps the highest result of the dice rolled.
Examples:
Sword4	+	Bless3	+	KnightlySword2	=	9DRs	. Or 9 divided by 5=1r4 or (d12,d10)
To roll would be:
d20 + 4(Prowess) + (d12,d10)keep highest
Preach5	+	Bless5	+	ChurchPodum1	=	11DRs. Or 11 divided by 5= 2r1 or (d12,d12,d4)
To roll would be:
d20 + 3(Spirit) + (d12,d12,d4)kh
KnightlySword2 shows how better gear could add to the roll. Nifty ClimbingGear1? Fancy Cookware3? These are gear bonuses for respective rolls.
ChurchPodium1 shows how the GM or players could designate additional bonuses based on the situation, setting or scenario.
Using Die Ranks & Dice Pool opens up a world of bonus possibilities, each with unique fun descriptors. It solves the problem of gaining too much power too soon with all the fun upgrades.




 
	Determiningdifficulty	
	Maneuvers	
GMs and players alike roll the skills of their players. They both use the d20 + Trait + Die Rank system. The goal is to beat a number called the Difficulty.
The default Difficulty is 12.
In combat, the Difficulty to hit is the Defense of the character. This is 12 + Awareness + shield & helm. There could be cover & so on. Separately, Armor Save (type of armor as DRs) is used to reduce damage. More on that later.
In moving about or maneuvers during combat or intense situations, the Difficulty is 12.
For treacherous terrain, like climbing a cliff or traversing a bog, the Difficulty is 12 + the Armor Save of the character! The GM can roll the player’s armor save in front of everyone and add it to 12. This total is the number to beat. Note: Use base armor die & not any upgraded version.
For extreme treacherous terrain, a GM can decide to add even more to the roll. But this is optional or for extreme situations that warrant more. The GM describes the additional factors.
It is stormy. It is flooding. It is dark. You are being fired upon. This is 4 additional factors.

If a knight in plate mail is rushing through a bog at night in a stormy flood as cultists shoot arrows at him:
The plate is already a d10 or 4DRs, the 4 factors are 4DRs, so 8/5 = 1r3 or d12 & d8
The Difficulty is 12 + (d12, d8)kh to slosh through the bog without losing some vitality or reaching their destination. The GM determines failure with the DRR rule on the next page.
	Skills	
There are various ways to determine difficulties for non-maneuver rolls, social and crafting skills.
Default difficulty is 12
One could add DRs of difficulty like annoyances, distractions, each adding a DR, to then roll and add to the 12.
Versus others
A Roll Off: traits + skills, who rolls higher
If a roll affects someone: Preach, persuasion, command, intimidate, distract & so on.
If a roll intends to counter someone else’s roll: Guard vs stealth, trade, blocking their move, parry an attack & so on.
Repairs
Gear, armor, weapons is a 12 plus the damaged DR. If armor loses all its armor save it is destroyed, for the rest beyond ~5DRs.
Determining
	Success	

The straight forward way to determine success is a succeed or fail outcome. For combat and many situations, rolling above the Difficulty is a success. This is used most commonly in this game especially to move the story along quickly.
However, there is a more detailed and slightly more involved and difficult way to process some of the rolls’ successes or failures. This is by using the Die Rank Result.
Designating DRRs for too many rolls can be time consuming but does help guide the GM on results. DRRs will have many options.
 
	DieRankResult,DRR	
The difference one succeeds or fails by the difficulty number, then halved is the Die Rank Result or DRR.
Ex: Total success roll 27 - 12 difficulty = 15 or half of that, rounded down is 7DRs. Ex: Total fail roll is 4 - 12 difficulty = -8 or half of that, is -4DRs.
These DRs can then be utilized in different ways by the GM or players, depending on the situation or purpose of the roll.
Repeated for Emphasis: Designating DRRs for too many rolls can be time consuming so decide if its worthy & fun or a bit much for the moment. DRRs will have many options.



DRR Fail Result Guide
Whatever one fails by, halved, is the DR penalty. Below are cumulative DR effects. The GM must decide if the fail is time, space or physical like pain. Whatever makes sense.
DRR Results, DRs:
1st 5DRs = Roll die for vitality drain as exhaustion. For time or travel or work, roll for additional minutes, hours, days wasted or taking longer. An additional loss of rations, supplies or whatever was needed.
2nd 5DRs = Temporary penalty caused by minor ache or sprain, headache, frustration, annoyance. DR damage to gear used or armor.
Beyond = Anything beyond 10DRs of fail can incur grievous wounds and be potentially fatal. If it makes sense. This can be transferred to armor.








DRR Success Result Guide
Use common sense on how long these take. To determine the difficulty is 12 + the DR penalty, goal or as noted.

First Aid: May reduce wound DRs immediately after injured. Only one try per wound. Meant for quick emergencies.
Surgery: Reduce wound DRs by this many DRs. Careful prepared roll taking time to do, gathering bonus factors. Rest required!
Prayer, Cooking or Comforts: How many inspired Die Ranks one can disperse amongst brothers & sisters.
Healing skill: Convert the DR to the dice pool, all dice are added together for the vitality heal result. This is not keep highest.
Repairs: The amount of DR penalty damage repaired. If it’s hull damage (vehicles), convert the DR to the dice pool and roll, the sum of ALL dice rolled as the amount repaired. If any extra die, they can reduce supplies, cheaper first or time or used as temporary inspired die to the benefactor of repair in next turn only.
Searching for Treasure, Loot: Resulting DR determines what dice to roll on a treasure or loot table. Extra dice pool result die is also rolled for a result. Nat20 doubles rolls to keep highest. Nat1 ruins area or causes a minor injury or damages something! GM discretion.
Aid: Simple aid is +1DR help but this skill is to roll a DRR to aid one. The aider should be able to help, having some knowledge or skill in the field to help. The DRR is a bonus to the main roll. A fail will increase the main roll’s difficulty!
Maneuvers: various can help add bonus to the action if it makes sense.
 
	combat	
Surprise & Ambush
If either players or NPCs are stealthy or oblivious, the GM may determine there could be a surprise roll off. The player with the best Awareness and/or skills rolls for the missionaries.
Each side rolls a d20 + Awareness plus any guarding or applicable skills. The higher roll gains the surprise or ambush.
That side gets one turn of maneuver and action before combat begins.
Take note of the targets being unprepared with shield, weapons, parry or anything like that. Regular defense and armor save is fine.


Ranges
Use common sense, but there is melee, short, medium & far off. Targets beyond medium may get +1DR or more to their defense.

Order of fighting
Preloaded crossbows go first.
Ranged weapons.
Spears & polearms with reach.
Lighter, bladed weapons and/or lightly armored. Unarmed, beast claws and teeth.
Heavier, bludgeoning weapons and/or heavily armored go last.
The above is meant to be a common sense guide for the GM. Narratively it may be that the order changes. Someone may choose to talk it out but is then attacked. If a player immediately knows what to do, the GM may allow them to go. Bad guys & beasts may have the tendency to attack first while good folks are more defensive.
If the GM senses hesitation on the part of the missionaries, which he should... The bad guys may attack!
If two feel like a tie, use the higher Awareness or a roll off: d20 + Awa, the higher goes first.

Combat Turns
Everyone takes one maneuver and one action or two maneuvers on their turn.
Maneuvers
Moving hurriedly about thirty feet without interference.
Melee, short, medium are 1 maneuver. Far Off is 2 maneuvers.
Blocking someone from moving past them or getting up as a roll off of Prowess and/or Awareness. Getting up. May seek cover if available, +1DR to defense.
May Aim, if no move or in melee, to get a +1DR for ranged.
May use DRR maneuvers such as cover, aim, parry, dodge, flank, charge and so on.
Reload crossbows or guns.

 


Blessings: If it is attacking or affects opponents.
 
Actions
 
Attack/Melee: Roll d20 + Prowess + skills to equal or surpass target’s Defense.
Shoot/Ranged: Roll d20 + Awareness + skills to hit a target’s defense. GM determines any range difficulties, adding it as DRs to the target’s Defense. Medium +1DR, far +2DR etc...
Aid: Simple +1DR to give an ally for their Action or Defense, like a feint or distraction. Using a skill, extending maneuver, & so on.
Free Actions
Done once per turn and does not hinder maneuvers or actions.
Blessings: Orally done that affect allies or self, like Bless, Heal, Protection and so on.
Speaking, pleading but not preaching.
Drawing weapons, rearming bows, pulling out gear.
Reactions by creatures can occur here, such as stomp or tail swipes.
 
Pain&suffering
Damage
Damage taken is based off the weapon’s damage die only. Smaller weapons are d4 or d6, medium are d8, heavier are d10 or d12. These can be upgraded like a skill! Players have Vitality and NPCs have Vigor, but they are exactly the same. Damage deducts from this.
When someone goes to 0 Vitality they are completely exhausted, unconscious or painfully delirious and incapable. See Life Saves for recovery or dying.

armor saves
When someone takes damage, if they have armor, they can roll that to reduce the damage.
Robes, thick clothes afford a 1 armor save. They can reduce the damage by 1 only, but to a minimum of 1.
Heavy robes & soft leather is d2, hard leather is d4, chain is d6, brigandine is d8, plated is d10 and full plate is d12. One can upgrade these just like a skill (fitting & improving) but if they are destroyed, they lose all upgrades with it.
If the damage die is comparable to the armor, it does a minimum of 1 damage.
These are also rolled and added to the Difficulty of 12 for any treacherous terrain maneuvers.
!!!Armor can be used to absorb grievous wounds, reducing their die by the same!!!


Healing Damage
Vitality or Vigor damage is based on cuts, bruises, exhaustion, minor sprangs and momentary pains. As a number, this can be recovered in several ways. A short rest will gain one’s Prowess or Spirit + d4. This can only be done once after taking damage.
Healing care, using the DRR method, can add DRs of healing to the short rest. A full night’s comfortable rest, with a meal, can gain all of it.

 



Nat20 Critical Roll
 
Grievous Wound
 
When one rolls a 20, on a d20, it’s always a success and has more effects. For combat:
Roll double damage of weapon!
Halve the amount of damage taken after the armor save. This determines the DR penalty of the Grievous Wound.
The target may transfer any of the DR penalty against their armor save. If the armor reaches no Die Ranks, it is utterly destroyed. A warrior may Sacrifice their shield or great helm and negate all grievous wounds of one attack.

Healing Grievous wounds
Wounds are much harder to heal. They require a roll each full night of rest to heal.
One must roll their Prowess or Spirit against Difficulty 12 plus roll the DR of the grievous wound. The DRR will make it better or worse! One could die in the night!
First aid care, then surgery may roll separately against 12+wound to reducing the wound’s DRs. This can have a negative effect if one does terribly!
The Miracle of Healing by the Nun is a special form of Blessing for Grievous Wounds and is detailed in the Blessings section. It is the one rare Blessing that can tie in with skills for a success roll.
Note: grievous wounds are meant to be a brutal and deadly situation! Yep.
 






Nat1 on a d20, roll d6
 
combat reference
Nat1 Foibles
 
Hit an ally! If nearby or in way of shot. Roll to hit them as normal. Or see result 2.
Hit an ally as 1 above. OR if none, hit thyself! Take damage immediately with armor save.
Fall foolishly! -d4 vitality! Weapon on ground beside thee! Roll Pro/Awa12 next turn to recover! Roll direction, may collide with someone nearby. They must roll Pro/ Awa12 to avoid or DRR penalty to their roll.
Fiercely stumbled! Roll your armor save as lost Vitality! If no armor, take d4. Damaged thy weapon by one rank. If no weapon, GM randomly picks one gear. Armor takes one rank of damage. If no armor, clothes is torn. One looks quite dismal.

avoiding foibles
If one has a die rank bonus to any roll and rolls a 7 or higher with a d8 to d12, they negate the fumble roll. This represents the skill level of the roller having less and less chance of fumbling.

 



A melee roll off, if both grappling.
 
Grappling
 
If one wants to escape, use Awa. If they win, they negate any grapple effect.
Either may add their weapon skill plus any grappling skill or unique feature like a net or tentacle.
The highest roll subtracts from lower and is halved. This DR can be split however as vitality drain and as a penalty to the target’s rolls. Each turn is a new roll with previous penalties also given as a bonus to the winner.



Point Blank & Ambush
For hand held guns & daggers!
PB can only occur if target is in melee range and is not aware of the shooter or so grossly engaged otherwise and NOT moving. PB hits on anything but a nat1 and is considered a Nat20 hit. It can also avoid armor saves and can choose a specific limb, like the head. Only first shot is PB.
Other melee weapons can only miss on Nat1 but do not get automatic Nat20. But do get a -1DR wound.
Grappling can only miss on Nat1, gets +2DR but can still be resisted.



Fire damage
Torch or fire of a lit arrow, d4 damage Campfire, d6 damage
Oil burning, d8 damage
Fiery pyre of fire, d10 damage
Roll damage, half or below it goes down, above half it grows! GM discretion, if highly flammable or drenched.

LIMB CHART, optional, d6
helmet, headgear, if none, pick heavy gear right arm: weapon, handheld gear, light items left arm: shield, armor, light items
torso: armor, heavy gear
right leg: armor, medium gear left leg: armor, medium gear
Headshot or Limb cripple
One can choose to go for a specific body part, but it makes it harder.
+1DR per factor: either is active or in combat, specific head shot, for eyes or smaller things, if target is aware of limb targeting. Add above to defense of target to hit ‘normally’
But must total 20+ or new defense, whichever is higher to hit specific part Nat20 always succeeds
Great for zombie virus that controls the brain Armor save applies only if limb has armor!
Limb could be crippled if substantial damage or crit applied.
Head shots are always crits if no helm or very thick monstrous skull.
 
Holy & Unholy Dice
There will be times in the game where Holy dice are used. Glory is a good example, where the Paladin calls upon God’s mighty justice to inflict additional damage in dire situations. This extra damage is its very own die and does not combine or upgrade the weapon’s damage die.
Conversely, unholy creatures may have a second armor save that is unholy. This die does not combine with their natural armor but is a separate die roll. Holy weapons, Angelic beings and the Glory blessing will entirely negate the unholy armor save die.
There may be other Holy or unholy die factors, all being separate dice from normal DRs. These dice are assigned to a specific bonus, from to hit, damage or for skills. They do combine as DRs with other holy bonuses of the same type and not with normal DRs, nor holy with unholy.
Using A Horse
Riding skill is rolled. Add any horse, tack bonus +DRs? Trained war horse?
DRR can be split for to hit & damage & for horse attack. Default difficulty of 12, but use armor save & combat factors too. Hoof+2, d6+d4. Rear kick+2, d8+d6 damage. Rear kicks have Crushing.
Regular horses should be -1DR at least.
No penalty for fully geared unburdened rider. Def12, hide, Save d2, Vitality22
Spirit d4. Whenever fumble rolled, beat Panic12 or ineffective. Rider skills may take an action to gain control of horse.


Villain death or surrender
If they go below 1, for all practical purposes they are dead. Optionally, especially if non-violent, like with rebuke, their 0 or less can be described as complete and utter surrender, exhausted or wrought with guilt and fear.
Denouement
At the GM’s discretion he can roll to see if a foe or group decides to back off, retreat, surrender or flee in panic. Below is a list of possible triggers. If one is a crazed zealot or possessed, chances are they won’t flee no matter the roll, but the followers may.
Upgrade die ranks if they are zealots, cult leader nearby, at altar, lair, demonic influence, on drugs, and so forth.
TRIGGERS
•	Takes a Nat20 hit
•	1/3 of allies fall
•	Down to half vigor

If one takes enough damage to be at 0 or less in Vitality, they must make a Pro/Spi12 save per turn. Grievous wounds add to the 12 difficulty! If successful +d4 Vitality. If failed, -d6 Vitality.
If they reach the negative of their full Vitality, they have passed from this life. If one recovers, they will be a -5DR first turn and get 1DR better per turn.


intervention
It certainly happened that missionaries were slain as martyrs. However at the GM’s discretion, an Angel of the Lord may intervene on rare occasions. The Angel will appear only momentarily to all present. Any Christian who recently died will revive. Any non-believer will flee in fear.
It should be noted that those revived may have seen Jesus. And He may have said to them, “Your mission is not yet done. But the next time you see me, you’ll remain at my side forever.”



Dying
One should not be afraid or frustrated to die in this game. Dying to save a brother or for the cause, knowing one struggled to do good and save souls is the utmost sacrifice worthy of a Christian. There are always more Christian brothers and sisters waiting in the wings to take up the Cross and carry on. In remembrance!
If the campaign or missionary group has a lot of glory points, and one player has to replace a fallen brother or is a new player, the GM can allow for some glory points for the new missionary or that they gain them at twice the rate until they match the rest of the missionaries.






Affliction
Poison, disease, sickness.
These are part of Grievous Wounds. Beyond -5DR is fatal.
Bleed#
# Equals amount of damage to trigger Bleed. Take 1 damage per round. Can be cumulative.
Sav12 with healing skills, 1 turn to stop 1 bleed. Heal bless uses 1DR per 1 bleed.
Down, Prone
-1DR to any rolls except crossbow or guns, which get +1DR if not in melee
+1DR to be hit in melee & +1DR damage received
-1DR to be hit by ranged
Takes a maneuver to get up. Pro roll off if contested!
Temporary Pains, Shocks, Exhaustion
-DR penalties, beyond -5DR is fatal shock, passing out, but not fatal unless unholy or severe in some way. 0 Vitality Life Saves are not necessary.
Caused by strain, accidents, over exertion and NOT by violent attacks. Only Needs Recovery time, shaking it off, minor first aid
Exhaustion is not part of grievous wounds or afflictions for healing or dying but its DRs are added to any penalty rolls.
Falling
+1DR damage/10 feet & it’s a critical with double damage & possible grievous wound. May use Armor Save.
Fear (see Shocks above)
Gives penalty DRs to rolls, beyond -5DR is paralyzing fear! Can not approach source of fear.
Use Spirit to resist and/or overcome at the beginning of their turn.
Fear can also end at GM’s discretion if the fight or encounter goes the missionaries’ way. Prayer can counter fear.
Restrained
Can’t move and/or use an action OR could be penalty DRs. See Grappling in Combat section.
 
	Penalty Dice	
Players and NPCs can get penalty DRs for various reasons. They do not apply them to their rolls. Instead the GM will apply them to two major factors, Difficulty and Defense. The GM will add these to any opposing rolls, defenses or difficulties as DR bonuses.
For simplicity, it is only used for one factor per turn. The GM may forget or forgo using.
The following are examples of penalty DRs. These are combined as the Penalty Dice.
Temporary pains, not fatal Temporary frustrations, not fatal Curses, fear
Blurred or blind vision
Minor afflictions like nausea, stings, rashes Worn or broken gear
Fatal if these total 6DRs Grievous Wounds
Afflictions like poison, disease, sickness


	Inspired Dice	
Generally gained through prayer, good meals and so on though the GM may award some for outstanding role-playing. It’s a DR to be spent & used when one rolls a d20 with skills only.
May be freely shared with other saints.
There is no limit to amount stored, though the spirit of dice awarded during prayer is meant for a specific purpose.


DierankbonusFord20rollsOnly
Any DR modifier, including Inspired, only adds to skill and action rolls that have a d20 roll. One can not add them to die rolls that do not include the d20. So damage die would not be affected by blessings, skills or inspired DR bonuses. One cannot add inspired die to faith point rolls for how many faith points they get for encounters or for the day.

	Resists	

For poison, disease, traps & so on.
Label the adversity and the difficulty number one needs to beat it, like Poison12. Assign a Trait to resist as shown below.
Poison12: This means there is a poison and one needs to resist it by rolling a 12 or more. Use common sense to apply a trait. For Poison it would be Pro or Spi to endure the pain. A player could persuade with great description, other traits that may work instead! Like Int... To know what to do to counter the venom or mind over matter, pain?
PitTrap14: To spot the trap with Aware. To leap away when it drops, Pro or Awa.
Blinding Flash16: To avoid the effect, Awa or Int.
Fire Spout18: To avoid it Pro or Awa. Or ouch!
The result of failure could be pre-determined like d6 damage or -2DR penalty. Or...
Scarier DRR Result
Whatever one fails by, halved, is the DR penalty. Below are cumulative DR effects.
DRR Results, DRs:
First 5DRs = Vitality Damage
2nd 5DRs = Temporary pain? Gear damage? Beyond = Grievous Wound, armor damage?
The GM determines the severity of the DRs. Generally avoid grievous wounds or death results unless a Nat1 is rolled or the resist is against something deadly.
Ex: Fail by 18! Halved is 9DRs. So 5DR or d12 damage, then -4DR pain penalty until GM decides they can shake it off.
 
Women’s Rules
“It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper suitable for him.” Genesis 2:18
As Christians and in pretty much all scientific research we know men and women are different. Simplistically we know women are not as strong and aggressive as men can be. While in roleplaying games we want players to play fantastical or heroic characters that seem to do more than we can in real life, this game still wants players to experience the true differences and contrasts God has given us in male and female characters.
It isn’t about women playing roles that befit men (like wielding battleaxes), but about women playing female strengths that befit womanhood. Women can never go above Prowess 3ish.
When resting, women gain an additional +d4 die bonus (as if holy) to skills in aiding, healing, cooking and comforting others, this is part of the Woman’s Touch. Biblically, this game & setting adhere to the rule that a woman can not be a pastor of a church. However a woman can use clerical duties of blessings, miracles, the power of the Word, evangelism and prayer to further the Kingdom.
Power of Prayer	
Christians can pray at the start of a mission or before an imminently dangerous encounter to gain DRs for Inspired Die. A prayer should be spoken, the prayer rolls their spirit, skill, any blessings and can be given aid by the Spirit Trait of another clergy. Use the die rank result or DRR method to determine the die ranks one can disperse amongst followers.
Clergy can add daily faith point bonuses to the roll. If the roll result is low but the GM is impressed with the prayer, a DR could still be rewarded. Unless they roll a Nat1!
Passing of Day & Night	
This game is meant to be fun and run quickly. Therefore day & night factors are for descriptive and narrative purposes. For night scenes, any game mechanics for darkness should be minimal, at best a 1DR factor. Shooting ranges can be reduced to medium or closer by. Use commons sense.
Short rests are easy to come by, nightly rests would require some narrative and story pacing determined by the GM. The villains have to travel to and fro just as much as the missionaries and are slow to react to any incursion. So having days to rest, to respond to things is the norm.
Trade & Mercantile Rules	
The denarri is the basic coin of post Roman times. The Germanic tribes and pagans use it. Other coins can be present, but the denarri represents all coins.
The basic value of things is in the chart below. One should start the price at the maximum of the die rank and lower based on the setting, quality and any other factor. Or raise it! Having a roll off between buyer and seller using society and trade skills will change the price accordingly.

DRs For d20 rolls only
Any DR bonus or penalty, including Inspired, only affects rolls that use the d20. One can not add them to die rolls that do not include the d20. So damage die or faith point rolls would not be affected by grievous wounds, blessings, skills or inspired points. One cannot add to faith points to increase blessings like Heal or Bless.
Why Die Ranks & Dice Pools?
Using this game mechanic allows GMs and players to freely add up bonuses from all kinds of sources and not have level limits. It keeps characters from becoming over powered with traits, skills, blessings totaling +15! When you have a dice pool, you can still fail. Players will feel threatened by regular guards even at ‘high’ levels.
In many games, there’s either a limit to skill bonuses or the players become so powerful they play like superheroes. The GM has to keep making more and more powerful enemies. Everyone turns into a “demigod” and the game becomes unwieldy.
In this game, one can improve their skills but are still mortals. They are still fallible even with great experience. The hope is that fewer mistakes are made but there’s no superhero, god complex.
Die Rank Notation
+d12 = typical 1-5 DR notation
+d12,d4 = dice pool = roll both dice and keep the highest to add to a skill roll or for damage rolls.
+d12+d4 = dice sum = roll both dice and add for power or military grade armor saves or to deal damage from a power weapon, brutal beast, holy or unholy attack.
In some Virtual Table Top simulation apps, one can type in these examples for rolling dice. The specific {...}kh is required for ‘keeping the highest’ of these dice.
/roll d20+trait#+d12
/roll d20+trait#+{d12,d4}kh
/roll d20+trait#+(d12+d4)
	Skill Test EXamples	
GM should funnel any unique descriptors into the basic game mechanics.
A knight wants to block a cult warrior from attacking the nun.
They must be reasonably close.
Requires a maneuver, as long as the knight hasn’t moved in the round already. Or may use up their action. Roll off of Pro vs Pro, may add maneuvering and/or guard skills.
If the knight beats the warrior roll, the warrior can only attack the knight.
The saints slosh down a cramped water filled tunnel. Treacherous terrain: 12 + armor save
Suggested failed results: first 5DR, vitality drain, 2nd 5DR temporary freezing penalty, 3rd 5DR damage/soaked supplies, possibly ruined! Success result: Make it. A fail makes it too, but at the above cost.
Players Creating Unique Situations
A rogue wants to jump onto the back of a giant primordial crab to slice off its eye stalks thusly blinding it.
Extreme Treacherous terrain: 12 + rogue’s armor save + 4DR (crab back, slippery, very unstable x2, so 4 factors!).
A fail will give the crab more Defense and means the rogue is adjacent the crab and not on it. A big fail or a Nat1, would mean a fall with pain. If the rogue succeeds at the jump, it will be bonus DRs to their swing but...
Going for a weaker body part still affords one their defense & armor save unless one opts for the Headshot or Limb Cripple in the combat section. That does give up to 5DRs in penalties but if successful could result in a critical with no armor save!
Do not create new rules or advantages in combat because a player describes a unique move that seems to give them some grand advantage. Instead, require them to roll basic mechanics with some DRR attempt and Head Shot or Limb Cripple and if they roll high on that, then they can describe an amazing maneuver and unique attack for storytelling flavor.
Require a maneuver roll, that if requested could be a DRR adding or penalizing their combat roll. If successful they can describe or glamorize it appropriately.


 
	Poweroffaith	
The Clergy & Faithful use their faith to call upon the help of the Almighty for Blessings. Not
every call a cleric or Christian uses is answered and struggles and tribulations will still occur.
But in success or failure, one must persevere in their faith for God’s Will!
Faith Point Skill
Spirit + DRs equals points one can have for:
Roll for each Encounter
Get faith points for intense situations or combat only. It takes only a few moments solace between each to reset.
Roll for the Day, Period of Time
Used for while at peace, during church visits or for civil situations. May reset per new setting, but not meant to be used over and over.


Using Faith Points
Declare all points to be used as a free action upon allies, but as an action if against opposition, before the Saint rolls any.
Deliverance: Amount of DR affect.
Optionally
Deluge: Amount effected.
Duration: Turns it lasts.
Duress: Added to 12, DRs against resisting.
Distance: GMs discretion based on above costs. May require 1 or 2 faith points for longer distance!


The faith points spent as DRs convert to dice. These are then rolled to determine the amount per factor. Deliverance DRs might be rolled as a set number or proffered as a DR bonus to a recipients DR rolls.



Leniency
Allow blessings to occur whenever, as long as it feels right. Allow blessings’ duration to not begin until needed.
Allow leniency in interpretation of how blessings work.
Allow Biblical references to expand on blessing usage or effect.
Allow a learning curve, as blessings’ rules should become more refined and narrow with GM & player experience.
Allow them to come up with blessings, but then know they must spend glory points to gain that new way from this point onward.




Examples:
Heal one person d8.
Deliverance3 faith points.
Bless d6 saints, d6 turns, at +2DRs. Deluge2, deliverance2, duration2 = 6 faith Protect d6 saints, d6 turns, +d8 to defense. Deluge2, Duration2, Deliverance3 = 9 faith Holy Mace +d8 to hit & damage, d8turns! Deliverance3, Duration3 = 6 faith points.
It is holy! It negates any unholy armor saves. The d8 is added as separate holy die from normal mace to hit & damage!
Preach to a large crowd, 10 faith for the Day
+5DR to preach along with Spirit & skill and 5DR to represent a large crowd.
 
	Blessingsoftheclergy	

Bless
A bonus die added to an ally’s to hit or skill roll. Can not add to other blessings. Exorcism
This drains vigor from unholy & possessed, harming the demonic & evil spirits. They get no armor or dark protections. They can resist. For dire, truly evil villains. Heal
This lasting effect adds to vitality. It does not heal grievous wounds. Holy Mace
Deliverance proffers die rank bonus to hit and holy damage, but needs Duration. Best on a 1-handed mace or hammer made for or by the Church. It is holy for to hit & damage. Best use is against unholy evil beings!
Preach
Gives bonus die to Spirit rolls to preaching and persuading groups to part from their evil ways during non-combat situations. Deliverance to affect. Use Deluge for crowds where d4 is small groups and d12 is large crowds. Duration & Duress aren’t necessary.
Prophecy
Done between missions, while in prayer or meditation, the faith spent affords a die rank roll result. It is saved for some future result and can be added to a roll after its result is known. Only one can be given at a time!
Protection
This gives one bonuses for defense. It must be done before an attack. The clergy rolls the amount and all affected add it to their defense. Rebuke
This removes vigor from human enemies during combat or for enraged violent mobs. Leaders may resist. They may flee or at zero they fall to their knees in humility or humiliation.
Resist!
This gives one ranks to resist against any curse, fear or affliction before it takes effect. It does not cleanse one of a curse. Revive
One that has fallen and died can not be healed. But if it has only been within this encounter, they can be revived with this miracle. They clergy must try to Heal them bringing their negative vitality to 1. Otherwise, they have passed from this World into the hands of the Lord.
Special Miracle
Once in a great while, one may spend all their faith points to plead for a special miracle based on the needs at hand. The situation should be dire or epic-- a great need. The GM will roll a difficulty adding as many factors as described, whilst the believer may do likewise with prayer, meditation, fellowship, and so on. A successful roll will be required for this to occur.
Studious
One may add faith points to academic inquiries that pertain to culture, history, Biblical knowledge, occult, philosophy, social fields, some basic geology, nature, health and medicines.



Codex of the Latin Vulgate bible	
Written on thick parchments or vellum as scrolls, chapter tomes and hand stitch bound books. HEAVY 2.
Manuscripts were very incomplete. A complete bound Bible copied on animal skin or vellum was the size of a medium chest and weighed 75lbs.
If a cleric lugs one of these around, they may add DRs into it as a skill. These DRs can then be used for many clerical duties, for Blessings, adding to faith point DRs, Prayer, preaching and so forth. They may also quote verses from it as opposed to from memory.
The manuscript will undoubtedly be a target for theft, vandalism or destruction.
 
	Blessingsofthesisterhood	


Call Out
May give a die roll to defense for an ally to use immediately against one attack. This call can be used at any time during a round even after the attack result is known. It only lasts one turn.
Cleansing
This gives a blessed die to help one resist against an ongoing curse or ailment that one failed to resist initially. This new resist roll bonus can be applied once per day to an afflicted soul during a rest.
Divination
With prayer and meditation before a mission, a nun may be given a vision of future things. (GM’s discretion, clues & mission info, mysterious, odd, vague!). A nun will roll this like a skill with DRs.
Heal
This lasting effect adds to vitality. It does not heal grievous wounds. Hope
This gives oneself or an ally a bonus die they can use on their next roll only. It can apply to anything, including damage and non-d20 rolls. I See An Angel
Used only once per mission or session, expends all Faith points one has left. Split die ranks for attack, damage, and duration. The Angel can not be harmed and his attacks are a Holy sword that avoids all armor saves. He can be very intimidating, especially if he causes harm to unbelievers. Fear, blindness or paralysis tests could be used. The resist would be Spi12 plus total DRs used. He may not always save those around him. The Nun faints upon his arrival. She is inconsequential to foes when the Angel is present. She will recover shortly after the Angel leaves.
Miracle of Healing
This specifically heals grievous wounds. It can combine and roll with skills, requiring a roll above the difficulty. However it can be instantaneous and will not make it worse. It is separate from other medical attempts. It can only be rolled once per wound per day. It can be used in combat for desperate situations but wouldn’t benefit from other preparatory skills.
Plea
This desperate plea can be used at any time and may stop anyone from doing an evil act. It can trigger a denouement roll or be a direct roll off against their spirit, anger and vile bonuses.
Repel
This form of rebuke can make any enemy flee the caster for the duration, generally desiring to avoid any other confrontation as they leave the nun.
 
	Paladin	

Armor of God
This adds a second holy armor save.
Holy Weapon
One’s weapon is given the Holy Effect. It cancels unholy armor saves for the duration. Getting a special weapon or having one blessed by a great saint could bring about the faith to gain this blessing.
Glory
This gives one a holy die for combat damage rolls and must be declared before striking. If one misses, they lose this faith points. It can use duration but counts down even if one misses.
Perseverance
This can add vitality to oneself to fight on. It does not heal lost vitality and the vitality given lasts this encounter with no duration required. It is always reduced before normal vitality is affected.
Righteous Anger
Using duration only, lowers the Critical Roll needed by 1DR only. Can upgrade the DR with Glory Points! One must still hit their normal defense for a critical roll to take effect. It is not the same as a Nat20 auto hit!
Warrior’s Sacrifice
This can only be used on oneself. Each die rank gives both vitality and attracts any enemies to chase and attack you only. It is resolved once you have fallen or the enemy is vanquished. This also condemns the enemy to violent means. Leaders may resist this temptation.







Holy Dice effects
Holy dice are always separate dice from any DR to Dice Pool dice when rolling for skills or damage.
If an attack or effect is Holy, it can remove or ignore any dark magic protections that resist natural attacks.
Possessed creatures may have some resistance to normal attacks and pain. Demonic presence usually have a secondary armor save die.



Blessings for All
Anyone can gain Blessings, but the clergy would start off with them and know how to use them, having high Spirit traits and pastoral training. Others growing in faith can gain them by using glory points. There should be a brief role-play on how they gain them whether through their clergy and/or mediation and prayer at an abbey.



Quoting verses, Bible Access
A missionary can only quote the Bible if they have access to the Bible or the verses. They may only have verses if they have the scrivener’s set and are able to read and write it or acquire them. One may memorize verses, rolling an Int12 +1DR per additional verse.
 
	Glorypoints&upgrades	

Glory Points are gained each time one plays the game and accomplishes certain tasks. Here is a list of how one gains 1 GP each.
Showing up to play!
Converting non-believers
Defeating a new stronger foe, hopefully in surrender Uncovering a pagan plot
Defeating, exposing or stopping that plot Setting up a church
Spending time at a church, to build it, mediate, train, teach. Giving large sums to a church
GM rewards for some miraculous reason
Keep a running total of and the unspent GPs:
Glory Points
Total/Unspent	30/2
Generally the missionaries will not spend GPs unless they are in between missions. When they are resting and helping at a new church or an old church. There, they can train, study and do spiritual things to then decide, describe and spend their GPs for upgrades.
Just about every thing that has Die Ranks is upgradeable. Generally, the cost to upgrade is the same as the Die Rank. Sewing3 & SwordToHit3 cost 3 Glory Points each.
Traits are the only upgrades that have a more expensive and unique way for GP cost.







Traits
Total of old and new trait is the cost in glory points. Cost is minimum of 1. So Trait+3 to +4 is 7GPs. Any Trait above 5 will require not only the GP cost, but one must subtract 1 from another trait. ~5 should be the maximum in a normal setting. The GM will decide if one can go above 5 based on the character & setting.
Adding a skill
There is no limit to any kind of skill one can come up with, but many useful ones are noted in the Character section. Skills give a DR bonus to that specific skill. They would fall under the Trait decided on by the GM and player’s description of its use and intent.
Vitality
Men start with Prowess + 6 + d6. Women with Prowess + 4 + d4. Divide one’s total vitality by 4 to determine GP cost for an upgrade. Each vitality upgrade gets a d6 for men or d4 for women.
Faith Points
Add a DR bonus to one’s Spirit for Faith Points. This is used for “Each Encounter” and “For The Day” point totals.


	makingamissionary	
Every character starts by allocating a +3, +2, +1, 0, -1, -2 to their 6 Traits.
It is best to place the two highest in Traits that benefit their calling.
They also get two skills at +1DR each.

	6TRAITS	
Every skill roll will have a trait bonus assigned to it. The GM and player determine the best trait, the most apropos that a character would utilize for that roll. The following pages are generalized usage of each trait.

	skilloptions	
The skills provided are guides on how skills work. Players can use these or come up with their own unique skills, especially as they play. Every d20 roll gets a Trait bonus but not necessarily a skill bonus.
While skills are noted in character callings, they are not exclusive. Anyone can use a skill from another calling but it is encouraged that one focus on their calling.

	When To Roll Skills	
•	Simple or repeated skill tests should not be done or minimally.
•	Many of these can be succeed/fail and forgo the DRRs if pacing is preferred.
•	Use Treacherous Terrain whenit makes sense (adding Armor Save to difficulties).
•	Players should not create new bonuses due to describing maneuvers or unique attacks. Instead, with successful rolls, they can describe that as the unique maneuver or attack.
•	Use Extreme Treacherous Terrain like an encounter, only for epic moments.
•	Do not repeat tests if they succeed. If they scale the wet cliff once, let them do
it automatically afterward.
•	Encourage them to use gear & cautious descriptions as added DRs to their rolls.
6Both take more time!
 
	traits&skills	
Every task, skill or roll will have a Trait assigned to it. The GM can decide which, but the player can also persuade or describe a specific trait to be used with specific skills or situations. Use common sense while following these guidelines. All of these are upgradeable as noted as DRs in some form.
Some of these are skills, some of these are categories of skills. Some are game mechanics like Add to Defense or Faith Points. Several traits aligned with certain skills could be interchangeable, like using Prowess or Awareness for dodge, climbing, leaping and so on.
This skills under each trait have some essentials but most are suggested, players and GMs are encouraged to come up with unique skills.

Weapon Upgrades
 


To Hit, Pro - melee


To Hit, Awa - Ranged
 
Add DR skill to that weapon type.


Damage, No Trait
 
Upgrade the DR damage for the specific weapon type. 1=d4, 2=d6, 3=d8, 4=d10, 5=d12. It can go into a Dice Pool that keeps the highest.


Upgrades of skills & weapon
 
Both weapon upgrades may have a mix of skills and gear. Keep note of a weapons particular upgrades, such that if destroyed, only that is lost and not the skill upgrades. Also, glory point upgrade cost is based on total DRs of weapon and not just the skill side. Do not separate skill & gear upgrades to lesson cost for GP upgrade. Keep it simple.

Armor Save
 
Increases the save as DRs due to continual refitting & adjustments. Only for specific armor. If destroyed the upgrades do not transfer to another piece of armor. Armor is all hand made and one of a kind.





Combat skills
 


Shield Work, Pro
 
May use one’s shield as a DRR for defense, foregoing the default +2. One may switch any DRs not used for defense into offense as a shield bashing ‘club’ attack.


Two Weapons, Pro/Awa
 
Still one attack! Must upgrade each weapon separately. Can only be medium or light weapons. Combine DRs for one attack. May choose which damage to use if successful. Or may use one as a parry. Its success will add to the other weapon for the attack & damage. An advanced & tricky skill! Do not use unless understood well!


Weapon Damage From Prowess
 
+1 per point up to Prowess. GP cost same as point gained. Melee only.


Perseverance, Second Wind
 
A warrior may use a DR to heal themselves, taking up a maneuver & action. They can upgrade & use as many DRs per combat, as they have in Prowess.
 
	mercenaryCalling	






Maneuver Skills
 


Aim, Awa
 
Upgrade the default Aim maneuver, applies to all ranged attacks. Starts at 2DR! Not DRR, just applies to next projectile attack.

Charge, Pro
 
If there is enough room, especially on 1st round of combat, a warrior with Prowess bonus only, may charge. The DRR bonus vs the Defense may be split between To Hit and Damage. If one is successfully attacked before completing the attack, like from arrows or a spears, the charge is negated. Order of attacks is still played out normally. A Nat1 fumble will have two roll results!

Dodge, Awa
 
May roll skill versus 12 & armor save. Roll the DRR to add to one’s defense against known attacks.

Grraggh!!
 
Each DR reduces one grievous wound DR one might receive in combat. It only works once per encounter. Vitality damage still applies.

Guard Pro
 
Each DR adds to a Pro vs Pro roll off. If successful, you recieve any attack intended for the one you are guarding. The difference, as a DRR can be added to one’s defense.









Maneuver Skills
 


Parry, Pro/Awa
 
May roll this against one melee attack. If you roll over the attack, it cancels the strike and may use the DRR to one’s own to hit. If failed, may attack last, but if hit, can not attack. Some weapons add to this roll.


Seek Cover, Awa
 
A full on defensive skill like dodge that gets additional DRs based on cover that is around. This all adds to the Defense as a DR to Dice Pool roll and takes up both maneuver and action. If the roll is high, the player may keep it each round, or may re-roll the result or even re-roll the entire skill again on their next turn.


Sneak Attack
 
DRs that can be used between attack or damage bonus on a surprise or flank attack. Can only use as long as target is unaware, surprised or engaged & unaware of the flanker! GM’s discretion.

	Advicetoall	
The Grande Minister must describe the scenery as best as one can, to create a sense of where they are, to transport them to the place. However the GM should be succinct and on average speak less then the rest of the party combined.
The GM should not act or describe what the missionaries do, not even the result but encourage the players to. However one may do so to encourage and guide beginners.

The GM should not interrupt or interject when players are role-playing their missionaries, unless they are playing the antagonists or supporting roles who might interrupt. Yet be succinct.

Everyone should react to other missionaries actions, be witness to and always be expressive, rarely, if ever, looking away or letting outside influences distract. Stay within the story at all times! There is time enough for the outside world.

One should not ask about what rule, trait or skill to use but simply describe what one does. Let the GM then figure out the rule, asking the player for pertinent missionary bonuses. A player should never use ‘hindsight’ or missing information to seek to change their course of action or outcome. Stick to the results for better or worse. A GM may ‘rewind’ if he feels he left out pertinent information but it should be very rare. For missionaries go forth with much less information!

One should be aware of their missionary’s strengths and weaknesses, as well as what gear they have to be most useful. Limit asking how one might use the gear and just try it! Use common sense to use it in many different ways. The GM can decide the difficulty of each task thereof, generally favoring creativity.

Be quick to laugh at each other’s jokes and uplift others with some light banter and self deprecation. Be aware that in a group setting one’s remarks may not be heard or may be spoken over by another’s enthusiasm. Stay encouraged and to keep having input. And remember, be succinct.
Role-playing, feel free to yell at each other, issue commands, bellow warnings, scheme, call out for help at any moment. But do look for the proper moment to speak, knowing all are practicing brevity.

Feel free to argue, debate and conspire but be pithy. Embellish and have fun but be pithy. If you still disagree, prefer instead to sulk or use other expressions so the GM can move the story along.

Be attentive at all times, remain in the story at all times. Do not look at your crystal devices or sparkling jewels, there will always be time for that later. Rare is the time you get to be in the story. This is repeated for emphasis!

As combat ensues be ready when your turn arrives, be ready to use free actions to aid your brothers & sisters. Be aware and reactive on others’ turns. Bellicose bravado may garner a GM bonus! But do not assume so!

Clergy always seek ways to discern the souls before thee with one’s Spirit. Be ready to preach and give the Gospel, even to the hardest of hearts.

Fighters be ready to defend the clergy and step in front of any danger. Be fit and healthy, seeking the healing powers of the priest or nun only when you’ve made it safe!

Nuns, be supportive and caring, seeking to aid the fallen, sick or cursed. Be ready to use your Faith in the most profound ways.

Finally a many thanks to the Patron Ladies, the benefactors for providing provisions and gear & their tireless support in building up the Church for the Lord. And milady, practice shooting your crossbow!

Sacrifice allows this item to be destroyed absorbing any grievous wound just incurred. Vitality damage is still taken.

Repair & Crafting	
Repairs
•	Basic gear & minor stuff is a 12.
•	Fancy gear, major stuff, roll the damage DR, add to 12.
•	A success repairs simple items. A close failure may damage it more. A bigger failure may destroy it.
Crafting
•	Use any factors the gear or weapon has and add to 12 to determine the difficulty. To hit, damage, lighter all add up as DRs. Medieval stuff uses the half of the total DR die. So a d10 damage axe would be 5 or 12+5=17 to craft.
•	Right tools & workspace are required.
 
Gear & Burden Rules	
•	Carry Heavy II, Medium III, Light IIII objects
•	Additional burden can be upgraded, see Glory Points.
•	Lighter gear can take up heavier slots.
•	Weapons and armor count as gear.
•	If burdened, treat mundane maneuvers as treacherous.
•	It is assumed one is utilizing backpacks, pouches and belts with scabbards and various bindings for the gear.
•	If one brings additional gear one can choose to set them somewhere in a camp, wagon, donkey or nearby church as one progresses on their mission.
•	Burden incorporates weight, size, fitting, and how items must be carried.
•	Patron Ladies can ignore burden, but her gear and what’s on the donkey and cart should make sense.




Wear and Tear (optional)	
•	Receiving a Nat20 critical or rolling a Nat1 can wear one’s gear, giving them a
-1DR or more as wear and tear. This can be determined by the GM or:
•	Roll d6 for limbs to determine area damage occurs
•	Each wear & tear is a die rank penalty for gear or reduces armor saves. For weapons it reduces their damage die.
•	Savvy or Intellect, proper skill, tools, time & materials can repair items using the DRR rule. Or one can hire a craftsman to repair via trade.
•	Presiding over a church plant will almost certainly negate costs as locals help the Missionaries prepare for the next mission.
LOW RULE	
•	Some expendable items can become LOW and if used up again are erased. They should be replenished if low. Low can occur on Nat1 rolls, GMs discretion and using common sense on things like the use of torches, lanterns, kits, rations, cooking and so on.
•	If the GM says they are used, mark the item as LOW. If they are already marked as LOW, they are now empty or out..





Crafting Upgrades	
•	What one upgrades too, would be the difficulty added to 12. Half of the DR die total. Same as crafting. But all other factors fo the item are added too.
•	Allow only one try per period of time, due to use of resources, expenses & time.
•	Sharpening a +1DR greatsword, d10 damage, to d12 damage = 1DR(d4) + d12 damage is 2+6 = 8. So default 12 + 8 = 20. Roll a 20. Or for a smith, 20 denarri!


Grandeminister’sGuide
The second part of this book is for the Grande Minister (or game master or GM). It is a guide and supplement on setting and encounters and how to make modular customizable encounter maps.
This game is generally mission based. So the GM should prepare the adventure around a specific mission the missionaries need to do.
The basic premise is to go to a certain village or settlement and plant a church. That entails going there and engaging the local population and leaders in some form. The following sections are charts and lists to help to determine the level of opposition and what may be encountered before one can peacefully establish a church in the area.
The initial investigation should generally start the challenges and intrigue. The missionaries will discover these and must figure out how to overcome them. There is always a possibility of conversion at every level however the degree of difficulty should always increase, to the point that some, especially the leader types, will be violently adverse to any conversion or Christianizing of the land and people they have dominion over.
The main game and storyline is a pre-set mission to travel to an area, discover the pagan plot, disrupt it and persuade the locals to support the planting of a church.
So basically:
•	Prepare a village or settlement on paper or with some map pieces of homes and buildings.
•	Set up some non-player characters with varying degrees of tolerance and hatreds. They will be local craftsmen, farmers, villagers and miscreants. If encouraged or pushed may provide clues to what is amiss. These can have a few skills, main traits and their own agendas, fears or concerns.
•	Have a few villains around to confront the Christians, decide their level of evil or potential good. Make them more prone to threats and violence. This can be a fun lowly combat encounter where they will quickly surrender & convert or retreat to increase the suspense for later.
•	Prepare a pagan site with map pieces where locals come to worship and submit. It can be a creepy grove or lost temple or cavernous space with an altar.
•	Prep a pagan leader, a witch or shaman. These will have a 1 or 2 magics for persuading the locals, 1 or 2 for controlling their goons and 1 or 2 for curses and self empowerment that they gain directly with their altar or place of worship and is generally a ritual to prepare goons for a final showdown.
•	Prep a tough brute or possibly a scary pet beast.
•	The missionaries must vanquish or weaken the pagan leaders and their enforcers. There are tables in this guide to help determine if a pagan leader can be saved or not.
•	Destroy the altar or sacred place and reveal to the people that the pagans are not as powerful as God’s servants. Through Christ, they do not need to sacrifice or be enslaved to other men. This can open the door to evangelize the locals and setup a church. In most cases this will be a few preaching roles and emotional role-playing. Certainly encourage some actual preaching and some pagan questions and responses. It is best to keep it light and simple, fun and enjoyable.
•	This is where the missionaries can heal their wounds, role-play any new upgrades as in learning new blessings or skills. They can get gear repaired and rest for many days, building the church and securing the region for the Faith.
•	They will then learn of new threats or news beyond the parish, that they must go and evangelize!
•	If the GM feels it’s warranted and/or the rolls are so bad, the local people could reject the Christians and threaten them, usurp all they’ve done or force them to flee
•	Rarely this could occur in the game, but it must be noted that this happened historically when monks were killed, a militant wing of the Church could respond to the violent paganism. This can be roleplayed as a new threat where new pagan leaders come to openly thwart the efforts of the church or locals reveal their own evil intentions.
When Missionaries Argue
Christians seem to love to disagree, which can lead to arguments. At some point the story needs to progress. Have each roll their strongest trait to persuade. Warriors will use their Prowess Trait to intimidate. Rogues may use their Awareness or Savvy as persuasive tools. Clergy will exhort or rebuke with their Spirit Trait. Patron Ladies will charm or lead with their social skills. Whoever rolls the highest wins the argument and all must go with that plan, willingly or not.
At the GM’s discretion, one may get a die bonus if the situation befits their trait, if it is a combat encounter Prowess, if it is against evil spirits, it’s Spiritual, if it is in a royal court, it would be Social and so forth and so on.

On compelling ‘upgrades’
For a story driven game, there may be an experience or event that upgrades a character or their gifts in some way. A warrior may have an epic battle that then gives them an attachment to their weapon and it becomes +1. A nun may have survived a sacrificial act with a gruesome scar that gives her one inspired d4 per day. A lady patron drops a rock out of her cart with such great success it may become a unique +d4 skill. Something nuanced or overt can give them an odd bonus to an item or specific skill as a reward for the intense, incredible experience. GM’s discretion!

If the character is a minor character played by the GM, just use the Min or minion first syllable adding any ending vowel or consonant to it. For craftsmen and reputable workers, a middle sections is added. And for lords, nobles, dire villain and clergy all three parts make their name. Choose to roll from either table. Roll a d20 accordingly, adding each part.

There are many writings of bishops complaining of many pagan practices within Christian lands. And there are many missionaries who were killed.
It has been noted that in Paris alone, in the 14th century, there were 30,000 sorcerers and much more witches. What may it have looked like in the country side? It is time for missionaries to get busy!

Demonic Activity & Evil Spirits	
Pagan leaders continually seek to draw demons to this world for their own mad drive for power and tyranny. Demons, fallen angels, dark angels, shadows, evil spirits are everywhere and continually call to pagans to do their bidding.
Worshiping demons gives them powers to possess humans, animals, swarms of insects, dead bodies and inanimate objects. Pagans will place dead guards in their tombs and temples knowing demons as evil spirits could possess these bodies and animate them as undead. They will have created rituals, drawn symbols and sacrificed animals for these type of guards.
Evil spirits can possess willing or sacrificed pagans, turning them into monstrous being of great strength and animalistic fervor. One might call these trolls or ogres, though there are listings for giant types. When demons possess animals, they are turned to feral beasts with rabid strength and ferocity. They can animate trees or add black magic abilities to things. They can control vermin and insects, summoning terrifying swarms.
All fantastical and horrifying abominations of God’s creation are enacted by the possession of demons. They generally only do this when pagans utilize their black magic to draw them to this world with sacrifices.
While demonic possessions should generally fit into real world creatures, certainly demons can appear as abominable creations that terrify the beholder. The level of horror and scare effects should be limited to the players and audience tolerance of such things.
For more family friendly, especially for younger children, the ‘possessions’ can be more of an effect of anger and selfishness. Pagans could be thieves, bullies and other things, using scary costumes and props to scare the locals, which was quite common.
As the players get older or more intrigued, stronger elements of demonic interference can be added as layers to a growing story.
Much of the creatures and challenges added here are from Biblical or Christian historical accounts with flavoring to fit role-playing game mechanics. For the main game and setting, the demonic powers have been ‘subdued’ to feral and ferocious temperaments. Additional supplements may explore and extrapolate on more dire demonic manifestations for the more grim and fantastical Christian role-playing fans.
 
cultureofpaganism
1.	Any god but God
Pagans are innately tolerable of other people’s gods. They like when gods are shared, stories are shared, even rituals and powers. What they don’t tolerate, is the view there’s only one Creator and they will be held accountable for who they are, for their actions. What they do like is that they can commit atrocities, then offer material sacrifices to manipulative priests and feel sanctimonious.
2.	Many idols & Stories
Pagans worship anything they can make up, whether statues of men or creatures, odd symbols or icons, trees, anything material that seems awe inspiring. Fear and emotions are useful tools to worship in this way. It is about a ritual of sacrificing to this thing and creating stories that empower them to gain followers, fame or fortune.
3.	Blaspheming and Sacrilege
Pagans do not mind insulting and swearing, even to children. Their care and consideration are practically null outside their own family. Many pagans have blood feuds for generations simply due to the fact that they continually insult and demean each other, their wives and children. This also spills over in how they treat others. Some may call for mutual respect, but if slighted, could easily turn to mocking & scoffing.
4.	No Rest For the Weary
Pagans have no compunction to let their slaves rest, to allow their followers any moment of respite. Day after day they enforce their tyranny upon others. After all they create their own gods. Aside from their own festivals, each day is another strung out day of fighting for power and controlling others. They could not bear their own slaves having one day to rest and worship God.
5.	Tribe Over Family
Pagans are more about gang warfare than family. Women are chattel, children are tribal property. Boys are forced to be warriors and raiders. All men are subject to the chief. The women are property and treated terribly, practically slaves. If it wasn’t for their beauty and a desire by the men to have some moments of peace, the women would have no life at all. Family is only sacred to the warrior class and the leaders. All else are subject to them.


6.	Selfish Desires
Pagans deal with others only for their own gain. They will lie, cheat, steal, murder and conquer in anyway for gain. Many say they will keep their word, but that’s as long as they are too weak to do otherwise, hoping the other will do the same. Some might be ‘noble’, but only for selfish reasons, and that can change on a whim.
7.	Deceivers
Pagans who are unsure of the situation will always come off as friendly and helpful. Once they have had time to conspire and know they have the advantage, their true nature will come forth.
Pagans can certainly lie. Why not? They can bear false witness whether against their own brother or to betray others. They’ll cause blame of their own acts upon their enemies. If there is no absolute truth or a Truth Giver, than any lie is the truth to pagans. There is no limit to their lies and false accusations.
8.	Coveters
Pagans love to steal, take and conquer others. They can be industrious, but many of their religions say to go and die in battle, to be furious, and to steal. It is their highest honor, if that were the right word, to kill others and take their stuff.
9.	In their own Works
Pagans do believe they are essentially good and that whatever evil they do is out done by the good they’ve done, the sacrifices they’ve made and the rituals to their gods they’ve performed. They believe that their evil acts will be outweighed by the care, charity and honorable things they’ve done. They believe that by what they do, they will go to paradise and be amongst the gods and their ancestors and that they determine their own fate, not their made up gods.
10.	In summary
Most pagans think they are good, want to be good, act good most of the time. They’ll help, they’ll care, they’ll be considerate. The above behaviors have to do with when they are being challenged, confronted or have been cornered into making a choice. There is no foundational discipline that requires them to be loving, kind, charitable or forgiving. In the end it is what is to their best advantage. Most have no idea that their corruption enslaves them all. They are unaware they need a savior.
 
	churchactivity	
Early catholic premise	
The Church and catholic or universal church in this game is not like the Catholic Church & debate we have today. It is more in line with the early writings of the founding church members and their Christian writings as well as the New Testament instructions on setting up a church with a pastor, bishop or priest. Much of modern Catholic doctrine was not developed till 1000AD or later.
The theology and evangelism of this game should be kept simple and fun and Catholics and Orthodox are welcome.
The basic premise of each mission is to be asked to investigate or evangelize a new area. There, the clergy should discover and confront pagan activities. A confrontation will ensue whether it can be resolved with preaching or met with some level of violence. Once the major pagan plot is thwarted, conversion of locals and church planting can begin. The missionaries are then rewarded with Glory Points to upgrade skills.
General Clergy Breakdown	
Clergy & Missionaries
Monk, Friar, Cleric, Priest, Preacher, Brother, Porter Ministers
Scribes, Scholar, Abbot, Rector, Vicar, Bishop, Prior
Nun
Sister, Cannoness, Abbess, Mother
Parish, Priory
Cloister, Monastery, Abbey, Church, Convent, Nunnery, Tomb, Cemetery, Ossuary, Hermitage, Friary

Popes During this Period	
Pope successions
John III (561-574), Benedict (575-579), Pelagius II (579-590) Pope Gregory the Great (590-604)
Roman senator’s son, a prefect at 30, then monastic until he became a papal ambassador to Constantinople. He then became pope. He paid the Lombards not to besiege Rome.
Successions: Sabinian, Boniface III, IV, V, Adeodatus I, Honorius I, Severinus, John IV, Theodore I, St. Martin I St. Eugne, St. Vitalian...
Spain becomes fully Catholic in 589 after much persecution by the Arianist heresy. Leaders & bishops converted. For simplicity, Arianist mixed Christian and Pagan beliefs.

Parish	
This refers to the church, its members and their activities in the local area.
Monastery	
Successfully converting local lords will gain financial gifts in coin & land for monasteries. These are where monks and nuns have given their life over to Christ. Remote ones are prime targets for pagan raiders and are usually defenseless. In a land full of Christian culture these can flourish and become places of support for the missionaries, but in remote areas and along coasts and borders, they could be sites to protect and if lost, investigate.
Each one can be very different. Each will have monks or nuns, each with skills in healing and some crafts from humble farming to superior workmanship. They can be a source for missions, church support, healing & rest and a setting for an adventure.
Academia	
Generally in larger cities and near the growing establishment of churches (not yet cathedrals) & monasteries, these buildings house clergy who see a role in understanding history and education. They collect all manner of works to archive history and understand the world around them. These will be a source of learning for academia, lore, crafting, the learning of magical realms and the lore of evil things. Scholars and wizards (wizened ones) may abide here.
Church	
The center of the Christian faith in each area is a building acquired or erected. These are not yet cathedrals but many may be temples of former pagans, Roman villas or a series of homes donated. The clergy reside in living quarters here and pastor all about them, as well as teach and send out missionaries.
There will always be a need, however dire, by the clergy of each local church.
Temple, Tomb, Cemetery	
Many of the more established villages, towns and cities will have old pagan temples and tombs. These locations can easily be sources of dungeon delving adventure. Rome had hundreds of years of powerful people creating and obsessing over burial sites and worship in dark, vile, esoteric, hidden places!

Gaining glory points during rest	
In addition to gaining glory points for planting a church, during a time of peace and spending glory points, missionaries may attempt to bear some fruit for the church locally.
•	preaching
•	helping around town
•	training the soldiers on proper behavior
•	engaging the local lord or leader
•	helping widows & orphans
•	setting up a monastery
•	setting up an orphanage
•	setting up a hospital
•	setting up a hospice
•	setting up a school
If a missionary, during down time, whilst the church is being planted and situated, as they await abbots and ministers, wishes to bear fruit, to do some good works, they may describe and roleplay things to accomplish. They should elaborate on all aspects to accomplish this task, as in engaging locals, financing, logistics and so forth. Whatever can convince the GM of successfully completing this task.
The GM will conversely come up with difficulties or any resistance. Both descriptions bearing DRs to the player’s roll and to the GM’s final difficulty total. If successful, a DRR is then finalized and one may roll on the Missionary Support table for a reward.

Missionary Support, DRR	
1.	Gain an inspired die
2.	Gain the DR rolled as trinkets, for trade in the next mission.
3.	Gain the DR rolled in inspired die.
4.	Gain one glory point.
5.	Gain one useful gear or supply.
6.	Gain one useful weapon at +1DR.
7.	Gain one useful relic, for +1DR of faith points.
8.	Gain two glory points.
9.	Gain one master crafted gear at +1DR.
10.Gain +1DR to any gear one has.
11.Gain +1DR to any gear, weapon or armor.
12.Gain three glory points.



On ‘Conversion’ & Mission	
Conversion for this game doesn’t mean they have come to Christ fully. It means they have had a change of heart and are willing to listen and allow a church to be established. Historically, while there were great and true conversions, many were forced or pressured to accept Christian ways. This is completely appropriate since the important factor was to civilize the pagans and setup a church so the locals could then learn from pastoral teaching and fellowship.
The basic premise of the game is to discern, discover, deploy, defeat and drive out the pagan influences. Once done, the ministers could build a church and preach conversion, Christian ethics, theology, reading the Bible.
For game purposes, whatever the tactic, there should always be pagan resistance or a pagan plot to do the same or to have already been established. Each mission should find the missionaries facing intrigue and opposition.
Defeating the local pagan leadership is the best way to open up the locals to conversion. There can be many levels of conversion, some being a peaceful resolve to an intense encounter. Others can be a conversion that has the pagans helping the missionaries or at least staying out of their way.
In history, many missionaries converted the lords who then supported monasteries and churches that influenced the local population.
With that success, the missionaries can rest and heal up. During this time, they can learn about other pagan threats nearby, explore to find them or be assigned their next mission via correspondence with papal or church authorities.

Small village would have a smith, tanner, farmers and maybe a few others like rope-maker and cobbler at best.
A larger town would have most of the rest except alchemist, perfumist, physician and parchment maker who would be at cities like Milan and Rome.
A merchant or trader could be present in these smaller settlements or along the road. A good Society roll may garner replenishments or needed gear. Patron ladies will have some social benefits. All others must roll their trade vs the Merchant’s to afford what they need.
If the merchant is favorable to the clergy, they may be able to use their Spirit roll to get some needed supplies, but nothing too fancy.

	PaganhexCrawl	
Hex as in witch! Use these various tables to determine the activities and agenda of locals & pagan cabals and how they will react to missionaries.

Below is a way for the GM to prep a mission, to give ideas and direction that the GM can work within, creating the opposition, their activities, motives and disposition.
The goal is to Christianize the land, to pacify settlements in accepting the planting of a church. It is to thwart the movement of pagans and the forces of darkness. DR: Some tables have DR to determine which die to roll. This represents the GM deciding to start easy, 1DR or d4, and advancing up to 5DR or d12. Use d4 for beginning games, keeping the options less harrowing, then d6, d8, d10, d12 as the missionaries become more capable.
Local Pagan Activity, DR	
There is always certain individuals leading the pagan rituals in the area. The list below provides the main focus or power structure. For new players, only roll a d4. Add die ranks to the roll as the party progresses in glory points and experience.
1.	Runs & owns the statues and groves where trinket offerings to local spirits or ancestors are placed.
2.	Criminal group posing as demonic or superstitious activity.
3.	Manipulative charlatans act as spiritual leaders
4.	Feared local beast or brute treated as idol, usually with local shamanic or druidic handling
5.	Feared sorcerer & minions
6.	A witch who serves locals is nearby
7.	Feared natural tree or spot. Pagan protected.
8.	Pagan cultist encampment, shaman & chief
9.	A coven of witches terrorizes the area
10.	Cultist temple erected, followers gathering
11.	Ancient site of horrifying rituals, haunted!? Or great beast lair! Pick a beast legend trope!
12.	Demon or powerful beast is haunting & corrupting the land. Roll D8 + 4 for support network. If result of 12, add some powers to it or its lair or presence.
To determine the strength of the pagans, base it off what the missionaries can handle. Start with weak opposition to get a feel for how many they can handle and how close the fight or struggle was. Build up each encounter to be a tad tougher with different challenges and tactics.
Look to use one or two black magic pagan powers that could increase the suspense and danger. Make sure to use annoying, fun and harrowing pagans who sneer, leer, jeer and scoff at the Christians.
Consider the locale and what resources the pagans might have for manpower, the quality of that but also, do the pagans expect opposition or have they gone soft, expecting all to comply to their pagan grift.

Pagan Motive of the Leader, DR	
Pagan Activity below an 8, can roll here to see how far the leaders have gone toward the darkness and what they are seeking. Roll a d8. Or roll a d4 or d6 for beginner games. Or up to d12 to push for worse and worse stuff!
1.	Good intentions, no really! Just didn’t know.
2.	Just desperate, might do more if no other way, frail
3.	Seeks riches through manipulation, a bit haughty and self serving, nothing a reality check can’t fix
4.	Finding riches seeks influence, has coin, may devolve to devious payouts for bad apples, may hide behind paid goons
5.	Finding influence seeks power (enforcers), has zealots, getting zealot! Must negate zealot buffer!
6.	Finding power seeks black magic, kind of gone, knows their power is evil now
7.	Finding black magic seeks demonic power, uh yeah...
8.	Finding demonic power realizes own damnation and are obsessed with tyranny and deception even unto themselves!

modus operandi, d6	
This list helps one further understand the style of play one could use for the pagans, the culture, look, attitude and behavior. This intensifies as one gets closer to the leadership.
1.	Lust. These pagans are looking to seduce and exploit anyone whose weak in morals and lure them to their own beautiful idols, pageantry and pomp.
2.	Manipulative: curses others, makes beasts feral, causes a ‘dark god’ problem that only they can ‘cure’.
3.	Vengeance: hates someone in the village, wants to slowly ruin them by torturing their souls, hurting their loved ones and destroying their reputation and wealth
4.	Greed: Coin and treasures are the goal, stealing and taking from locals, they want riches through criminal activity. It could be a con or through intimidation and force.
5.	Pure Malice: The desire for violence, death, destruction, especially by their followers and in ritualistic sacrifice, pure chaotic evil.
6.	Tyranny: The desire to rule over others by force, by fear. These are lawful evil and the most manipulative of all, using the other MO’s above to control everyone.
 
Location source, DR	
The location or center of the pagan activity.
1.	Encampment, nomadic, caravan
2.	Encampment, bandit or war band

Location Extrapolation	
Use the DR above for below.
Established location feel, DR

•	Roll on Real Plot, d6 to see what’s really going on.

‘family friendly’ paganism, DR
This can be a refinement or clarification of pagan activities. Still violent options, but sexual content removed. This can help with lessons, debate, arguments in evangelism. Each higher step includes the lower activities.
1.	Friendly white magic healing and frivolities
2.	White magic to heal, whilst using black magic to harm, they are probably the cause of local ailments, that they then offer to cure and gain influence.
3.	Bullying and Cursing Others for gain, for conversion. They will align with the most recalcitrant or trouble makers or greediest to weasel their way into positions of control, authority, ownership over others.
4.	Using rituals, readings, preachings amongst locals to control them, beguile them, extort or offer solutions to problems they usually cause. Or if there is an outside problem they may align with it. They will appease, acquiesce, cede to whatever is more tyrannical.
5.	Using potions (drugs) as advantage over others, they are definitely alchemists or herbalists crafting such. These can benefit any of the stats usually having an addictive and destructive effect.
6.	Animal sacrifice, cruelty to animals will pervade amongst their shrines and altars. Undoubtedly a cruelty and sadism will pervade amongst them, especially the leaders and zealots.
7.	Ruining others crops, property, wealth via potions, rituals, curses, vandalism, criminal activity and/or fear creates a culture of high stakes criminality. The prosperity of clans or houses without a foundational charity will breed strife. Since there is no forgiveness, the cycle of vengeance will be for generations and pervasive.
8.	Intimidation, gang like, vandalism, theft, terrorizing, a step further along then 7, it has become a destructive culture devolving from a semblance of citizenry to one of barbarity. All out clan wars is inevitable. Taking sides is expected or else!
9.	Slavery, of own or others, for gain has created something of an empire or clan with a purpose. That is of slavery with many auction and slave houses, blacksmiths making shackles and worse, and prison wagons and more. The business of slavery has pervaded the land!
10.	Blood thirsty gladiatorial arenas and slave filled circuses. To all they have accepted the worthlessness of human life, as offerings to their lust for entertainment.
11.	Outright murder, conquest, slavery, end goal of tyranny, a decaying culture all around with bloated temple priesthoods and clans hiding away knowing murder and backstabbing is the norm.
12.	Outright human sacrifice. If too much for players, resort to 11. Or could be rare or just clues of one done awhile ago, want to do again. Or one who ‘willingly’ sacrificed themselves.

More Adventure Ideas, DR	Below is a list of ideas missionaries can stumble upon during their travel to a main storyline or these can be added to the edge of an adventure map, scope, setting!	
1.	Raiders or bandits are terrorizing the local area as they pass through. If too successful they may just stay!
2.	Hun or pagan raiders have a nearby encampment. Huns are a scary lot coming from the far east. There were many myths about them as trolls, born from marshes, vampires, beastmen and the like.
3.	Slave traders have setup an illegal operation to kidnap locals. This may be to benefit pagan activity or raiders from afar. They should be very scary and well organized.
4.	There is a murderer nearby who has gained one demonic power that he uses and is influenced by. Make it scary! Scaryish!
5.	A bear or boar of unusual size and ferocity has terrorized the local farmers & livestock.
6.	Some ex-soldiers or barbarians have taken over a place from a known lord or monastery.
7.	There is a local plague that has made all the rats rabid! Zombie rats! An unusual size?
8.	A warrior with a demonic power and his gang are attacking merchant wagons.
9.	A small settlement or town is asking for help against a vicious tribe of barbarians that will attack them very soon. This should be a small clan of evil cousins and the like, moving into the area with their hag sister-wives.

12.	A dragon or draconis raptor is eating the local livestock & spreading fear. A dragon, no doubt, will cause fear and could incite pagan activity!

	localdisposition	
Conversion Level (CL), d8	
Use two d8 keep lowest, for really evil stuff! The numbers equate to DR for DRR.

1.	Violently Evil. Will seek ways to attack outsiders as ambush or thuggery or if surprised. They run the area openly or with skulduggery. +5DR resist! If these resist, it is permanent, not Chosen.
2.	Manipulative Evil. Will use violence to enslave if at great advantage. Otherwise portrays themselves as victims. Beyond salvation, only something violent and extreme could get them to instead serve the Church. Betrayal is never far away from these lost souls. A strong Church could keep them in check, somewhat.
+4DR resist!
3.	Evil as Chaff, tends toward selfish needs, can be manipulated. Tends not to use violence, like a greedy merchant, but will if they can get away with it. They surrender to save their own skin. They have feelings of worthlessness, if affirmed, may lead them to conversion, but rare is the soul in this group that is Chosen. +3DR resist!
4.	Neutral Evil, very suspicious, cautious, defensive, prone to outbursts of violence then shame. Something calamitous or profitable could sway them to more evil. Their anger is destroying them. Will they be called to freedom? +2DR resist.
5.	Sinners, having resorted to evil, do not like it. Open to an answer. They feel guilty. They will avoid helping anyone for fear of retribution. Their greatest fear & love needs to be revealed to them.
6.	Listeners, having heard the answer, knows there must be an answer, seeks it. Still defensive, still apprehensive and fears Evil all too well. A great preaching or selfless act may help.
7.	Considering the faith, seen Christians at work, has had positive run ins with the Church. Still holds to old ways, could fall back into evil pagan practices but certainly hoping for a better way. Seeing successes against pagan threats could bring these out.
8.	Christian. Fully committed to the Christian faith, loves it and Jesus and seeks to learn more and help out of possible. Will not join in adventure but would help defend, be a source of information and warning, and could provide logistical help.
Reminder: Conversion shouldn’t really have a chance at success until after some important factor has been removed, or a dire, violent situation has been overcome!
 
	Pagan Activity examples	
1.	Runs & owns the statues and groves where trinket offerings to loxcal spirits or ancestors are placed.
Local woman thinks she’s spiritual. She finds it easy enough to charm locals with soothsaying, mixtures and rituals. She may resort to hiring local thugs to threaten missionaries for impeding her business.
2.	Criminal group posing as demonic activity
A more sordid small group with costumes lurks about causing real terror while getting locals to give sacrifices at groves and altars. Can be cowardly or prone to violence. It may intensify when a real sorceress is attracted to their activities and joins or exploits them.
3.	Manipulative charlatans act as spiritual leaders
Merchants or any other connivers have set up their temple or grove and are gathering followers, wealth and power. They are intimidating local residents. Any resistance makes them resort to haunting, cursing, and eventual violence.
4.	Feared local beast or brute treated as idol, usually with local shamanic or druidic advisor
A beast has grown to prominence and is used to getting a meal by the locals. They revere it as a god. There is only one way to prove it is nothing more than a beast! Extra: Local zealot pagans may aid the beast.
5.	Feared sorcery & minions
A sorceress has gained new dark magics and is using them to threaten local leaders and gain wealth and power. She has strengthened her warriors and seeks worship from all.
6.	A witch who serves locals is nearby.
A witch uses her good magic to help others, but may be the one causing the sickness or curse that they need help with. She can not be persuaded to turn from her ways. She is always at the periphery of demonic forces, especially impatience and anger. She has tricked or convinced a few ruffians to protect her with her magic & drugs.
7.	Feared natural tree or grove. Pagan protected.
Pagans have long used this spot or natural idol to worship and sacrifice. A local tribe has warriors guard it and priests who tend it and receive worshipers. They will have black magics that empower their presence with fear and force.
8.	Pagan cultist encampment, shaman & chief
A powerful tribe has a rich history of pagan activities. They will have several shamans of young and old, warriors and beasts amongst them. They send out marauding groups to enrich themselves off weaker tribes and passersby. They use their rituals to build up a frenzy and take alchemical potent drugs.
9.	A coven of witches terrorizes the area
A powerful coven of witches reside in a remote area. They have control of the tribe and warriors to do their bidding. They require much sacrifice as they give the warriors special powers and abilities through alchemy and sorcery. The warriors appear and fight like beasts!
10.	Cultist temple erected, followers gathering
A sorcerer of great success and power has built or is building a greater altar and temple to a dark god. He will have great warriors and much wealth, probably due to raids and tribal worship. The temple will be large, elaborate and something of a ziggurat with many rooms and a large temple area with a great idol and sacrificial area.
11.	Ancient site of horrifying rituals, haunted!?
A dead site, filled with cursed and demonic forces, this area will not have man but will have evil present. Traps, tombs, feral creatures and evil spirits will haunt the area. It must be cleansed!
12.	Demon or powerful beast is haunting & corrupting the land. Roll D8 + 4 for support network. If result of 12, add some powers to it or its lair or presence.
Too afraid to give an example. Just kidding. A demon will be possessing a beast or pagan. The demon will have given the possessed supernatural powers beyond just black magic. They will have horns, red eyes, powerful claws or any other physical feature that makes them look and fight demonically.
Larger beasts such as giant boars, bears, wolves can take on these malformed demonic monstrosities. Dragons will also be possessed, making them seem fantastical, intelligent and having magical powers. Humans that have succumbed to this could become larger, bear horns or demonic features and other frightful appearances.
The more intelligent ‘human’ versions should be considered bosses or leaders who are discovered & encountered at the end of a campaign or series of missions. They will have influenced pagan tribes throughout the land and can only be thwarted after dealing, in a progressive storyline, with their many cabals and followers. These are used to overthrow local leadership or churches and spread the cult.
 
	PowerofEVIL	
Magicians and Witches are the source of pagan evil that drives unbelievers. They may be the leader or advisor to a ruler. They will lead any rituals and call forth demonic powers to do their bidding. They will be the source or at the source of whatever pagan plot is unfolding.
There are several classification of the black magic that men use. The sorcerer, warlock and magician are the most common. Astrologer, shaman, diviner and other titles can also be used. There are plenty of crossover but also some distinctions that can be delineated. Each caster can learn other fields while yet refining and expanding their preferred form of devilry.
The aspect of making a deal with the devil did not come into play until the medieval ages around the 14th century. A dark time where the word ‘witch’ and making deals with the devil are noted.
For the purposes of this setting, most are affiliated with Roman/Greek, Norse gods and spirits. As the Bible states, all idols and godly worship are either demonically influenced or one’s imagination.
Some basic concepts concerning pagan caster titles that this setting suggests is that sorcerers are more into power and pain, necromancers deal with the dead, and possession of objects or corpses by evil spirits, warlocks tend to use their powers to support conquest and war, shamans are local pagan clerics who advise and empower a tribe and its leaders, diviners, fortune tellers & astrologers use things in creation as rituals and symbolism to give others future tellings based on their interpretations, magicians can be a general term but also one who focuses on leaders and courtly matters in civil areas. These tend to have a good social standing and are advisors our sought out by many in the court. They could be viewed as charlatans or dilettantes, but others think magicians will give them the foreknowledge or advice to succeed in wealth, power, fame and lust.
Magic Points
They require the average of Spirit & Intellect or Society for Magic Points to perform their magic. The average of these two rounded down gives one their total magic points. The two traits reveal how they must perform and utilize such dark arts.
Whereas Christians rely solely on the Word through the Spirit trait, albeit some utilize relics, it is more an encouragement or focus than necessity, pagans rely on creation and not the Creator, so their magic requires preparation, rituals, pageantry, performance, potions and other physical things.
Is magic real in this game? Do we believe in the power of demonic influence? Yes. However the power of persuasion, drugs, seduction, addictions and so forth make pagans susceptible to worldly passions. The vile ways and demonic possession of blind anger, frothing rage, uncontrollable urges, reprobate minds and all sorts of self destructive behaviors might make them more powerful or magical but it also enslaves them to their vile madness.
The actual possession and control by demons is possible but should be rare and utilized as the climatic finale.
If witches can drug or seduce minions to do their will that would be easier than summoning evil spirits to control. But in the end, they can’t help themselves, they will inevitably resort to demonic control; for their fate is sealed.

	CURSES, MALADIES, BLACK MAGIC for combat	
Duration: This factor isn’t necessary for black magic in general. It can end naturally, through prayer or at GM’s discretion.
Fanaticism (damage die)
Gives a minion a DR to their combat damage and denouement roll. Should have duration!
Condemn (fear caster)
Causes fear onto a target, giving them a penalty roll. They can not approach the sorcerer.
Charm and Control
Cast to keep one’s minions riled up or spiteful and gives a penalty to any chance at knowing the Gospel or conversion. Usually done against preaching in a civil situation with deluge. The casting gives them a resistance roll against the preaching roll.
Curse of the Spirit
This gives one a penalty die to any Spirit rolls for resistance. It is a free action against any minion nearby or an action against a clergy to befuddle them for a time.
Harm, Pain, Suffering
This can do d4 damage to a target. It can appear in various forms like dark tendrils of smoke or a puff of poisonous particles or the grip of the caster. A Spirit or Prowess resist is allowed. In essence it drains their vitality.
Hexen - Curse
This curses one to suffer an additional d4 damage die whenever they are harmed. Duress and deluge are needed.
Malady, Foul Conjuring
This gives one an affliction condition that gives a penalty die to any roll due to some form of ailment like poison, disease, panged. It will add to grievous wounds. It is usually in conjunction with a puff of powder or a spit of poison!
Repulse
This rebuke adds a penalty die to any rolls the target may do to harm the caster. It is a free action and may use the Self Pride rule.
Wound Grievously - Curse
One becomes susceptible to +DR wounding for the duration! A resist is allowed!
	Vile rituals	
These are cast as rituals and the caster or followers could have these effects active for an encounter. Any of the black magics above can be done as a ritual. The GM can decide the extent, sacrifices, deluge, duress and deliverance.
These make for challenges: a goal to hinder, a ritual to disrupt, a place to destroy.


Concoctions, Brewing, Alchemy
This creates potions & poisons to be used as an action or right before a fight. Generally they can add a d4 or more to combat, damage, vigor and/or resistance. They make the creature or follower more powerful in some way. This is one of the ways to make bestial forms from God’s creations. The making of these is costly, requiring a cookery of sorts, ingredients gathered and time to cook. A valuable location to find and destroy by the Church!
Dark Vision
Seeing prophecies this can give oneself or a follower a vision. Each die rank rolled can be given to a follower to use on any future skill roll once.
Deranged
This weakens a weak soul, to make them susceptible to coercion and charm, doing the bidding of the caster. It can make the minion turn into a bestial warrior fitted with furs and accouterments. They become the beasts!!!!! Here one can create beastmen aka goblins, dwarves, elves, orcs, trolls and so on.
Demonic Possession & Feral Ferocity
A magic spell requiring much sacrifice and ritual. This gives the target powerful demonic influences. The scope of powers should have a great strength but also a debilitating madness. It can give great prowess and vigor while being susceptible to rebuke. It could be an incredible cunning but fear of holy symbols.
If it is placed upon creatures they are now feral and bloodthirsty. These beasts are usually put to sleep, possessed, then placed somewhere for maximum impact. They awaken or are released to terrorize the local population.
Hexen, Curse
Witches can make their maladies last much longer than just an encounter! This requires severe sacrifices and rituals. Usually it is a specific target. It requires making a deal with the devil or demons. The location will give clues as to the curse and target. Some may not even know they are cursed and consider it bad luck or an ailment. Clergy can use their Spirit to resist, detect or cure but all of this is contingent on the story, the GM’s discretion, the plot and how the curse was created and used. This can be the central plot of a mission!
 
	Magic Attacks	
Christians are not wont to use ‘magic’. There are two ways of looking at these, none involve the nature of God or of a Christian ethos. One way is in the form of trickery and deception, utilizing confounding elements of alchemy to cause advantages & destruction. The other is in the form of asking for demonic powers to change an outcome.
While Christians certainly understand the advantage of strategy and tactical weaponry, most of these, in the Dark Ages, have not yet been studied as such and are a concoction of manipulative and diabolical minds. Their purpose in using these is to overpower their foe with something akin to magic and power.
Most of these can be interpreted as Deliverance, Deluge, Duration, Distance and Duress. They will affect something directly, whether it’s vitality or an affliction. In some cases it’s obvious like fireball, but most others it will probably be a DRR fail that causes a penalty DR whether as an affliction or temporary penalty. Or, simpler, the GM can predetermine a penalty upon failing to resist or avoid it.
An affliction will require serious healing consideration and will be combined with grievous wounds that are fatal past 5DRs. Some could just be temporary ailments that are not fatal.
Pagan casters will use magic points, that can be referred to as black magic points, preparation or prep points. They average their Spirit with another Trait based on their style of sorcery. These points can be upgraded with die ranks.
If a Christian uses magic to help them in these adventures, the pagans will believe the magic over their faith, blessings or salvation in Christ.
	Fumble on a 1!!!	
An interesting rule for magic or elemental attacks is that a roll of 1 on any of the prep points could cause a fumble or mistake. Some are minor and nuanced at the GMs discretion, but others are major, like the fires and destructive ones. The caster can have skills or raw talent to avoid the calamity and continue the magic rolling above a default 12. Sav and Int are the main traits, but some could more about Soc or Awa, at the player’s roleplay and GMs discretion.
Fireball
Many wizards and magicians will have mastered some sort of fire attack, if given this task or utilized to gain favor or power. These could be prepared grenade types or malatov-like, but always done with a magical flourish.
Deliverance: damage
Deluge: Special rule, if a 1 is rolled, burn self or minions, but important characters can try to avoid with Sav/Awa12 as normal, use Fire Damage for potential growth
Distance: malatov, grenade types
Duration: See Fire Damage table
Duress: Only for main characters, using Awa12 to avoid.

Fire damage	
•	Torch or fire of a lit arrow, d4 damage
•	Campfire, d6 damage
•	Oil upon one, inflamed, d8 damage
•	Fiery pyre of fire, d10 damage
Roll damage, half or below it goes down, above half it grows! GM discretion, if highly flammable or drenched.
Smoke
Similar to fire, but having more a temporary disabling penalty. The gas can be temporary penalties like blinding, coughing or produced from fire to be fatal if forced to breathe for too long. Deliverance or duress act the same, requiring a resistance to the effect. Deluge is important for how many and like fireball can include oneself if the deluge rolls a 1.
The caster may have distance prepared as a tossed or flung container.
Poisonous Cloud
See smoke for stats but a failed resistance to this can be a preassigned die rank affliction or due to DRR failed one. This is based on the capabilities and preparation of the witch. Having a certain DR affliction is somewhat safer to implement game-wise than a DRR which could be fatal on a bad resist! Only witches that are considered very deadly should have deadlier preparations.
Blinding Light
An immense and sudden explosion of brilliant light that could be a temporary penalty or an intensely debilitating blindness. Again the scope and knowledge of the preparer determines the intensity. A temporary penalty means there is -DRs but they can still act. A severe blindness should require at least 6 die ranks worth of preparation in whatever result they prepare. This is akin to going beyond 5 DRs for afflictions to be fatal. This is a temporary blindness and is not considered permanent! This one means they can not see at all and have perhaps -12 to every roll or the GM could use random directional dice for any attempt at attacks or movement.
This can have deluge and duress. Distance may help. This can be done on the spot or as a ritual prepared ahead of time. Stocking up a lot of it is not a ‘thing’ in the Dark Ages and most must be used up while ‘fresh’.
Illusion of the gods
This black magic is about swooning followers with miraculous signs. A sorcerer can do it on the spot or prepare the illusion or a combination of preparation to increase many of the factors and utilize encounter magic points for the final execution. This magic can be anything from minor tricks of light, reflections and shadow, to the theatrical release of doves as a sign, to more extravagant showings of projected lights and reflections around idols & statues and the observance of mystical signs. Deliverance and duress are pretty much the same. Deluge will aid in how many it affects, it doesn’t have to equate to a specific number, in so much as a portion of those present, having the result of 12 refer to a very large audience and any number below a fraction of that.
 
Signs of the gods
Similar to Illusions, this is a preparation or immediate usage of encounter magic points to show a spectacle to get others to believe in their paganism. It will require physical trickery, some showmanship and persuasion. It is a con to be sure, but one with skill, acumen and a bit of luck.

Nightmare Attack
This can be a curse or warning that witches would do to scare anyone. The performance is so convincing it would make one have such stress and fear it would cause them nightmares, panic attacks or so forth. It could be to get them to submit or become so distraught as to be useless or helpless.
It could go beyond psychological, mental and into the realm of real black magic, demonic hauntings. And these are Biblical, having such accounts. But to what end witches can utilize this is to be determined by the GM’s game.
Destroy Stone
Akin to an engineer or sapper’s abilities, this wizardry attack can make stone crumble. It is a devised concoction or explosive or otherwise that causes such damage as to make structural stonework collapse. It is generally not for solid natural stone, but man made that can fall if an area were to be structurally compromised. Utilize deliverance as direct damage upon the stone, having duress reduce its armor save, deluge if warranted but if it were structural, one area might be enough to collapse it. Distance if it were devised as some sort of rocket or lobbed grenade.
Blazing Pig
A strange and odd magical effect! But one Samson and medieval folks have used. It could be other local fauna, but the pig is most common. The flame with oil upon a pig can turn into a mobile flaming attack. Deliverance for fire damage, deluge for how intense and large, duration to make it last, duress to control the pig’s direction! Some of this could be preparation for the day, whilst the final is during the encounter. Like many rituals here, combining for the day and encounter prep points should be possible.
This is literally an engineering feat of war!
Oil, Tar & Fire
Using more controlled elements, fire can be placed as a wall, a line and be long burning. It also has more intense chance for longer lasting fire. It starts as an oil and is generally static or stuck to where placed. Any roll of a 1 on any prep die used could be dangerous! Just as fireball! However the preparer may not light it (rolling final die) or may roll their fire safety skill Sav/Int12 to avoid catching on fire. They may have gotten the oil on themselves!
Magic Tricks
Definitely illusions, these prestidigitation type magic could be as innocent as entertainment or as dodgy as thievery, skulduggery or as part of the rituals and illusions to affect worshipers!
Piercing Cry
A witch’s banshee wail, these are used in rituals and intense situations for several reasons: one, to boost the deadly morale of her followers, two, to unnerve those resistant to her charms, and three, to affect those in battle against her will. There may be horns, instruments or other things that aid in such a strong shrill scream.
Booming Voice
As the witch’s wail but generally for sorcerers, the men who are really in charge even as the pagans claim no genders and that God did not make us male and female! These men have spent countless hours working on such deep booming actor voices, to affect their own or to rebuke the followers of Christ. Expect this voice to have an affect, however temporary, to possibly change the course of evangelism or battle! Use this to boost the morale of his followers, give bonus die to them or to unnerve his enemies.
Overview of Limitless Magic	
As much as magic spells have been described here, consider these examples. All magic spells are all basically a resist, roll off or DRR type effect. One need only think of what that oppressor, that witch or sorcerer has as trappings, as an agenda, as to what is their environment or what sort of lair and cult they have created. What would they have access to -- to then use as a magic, a weapon.
In this, one can devise any type of magic attack they deem, that utilizes Deluge, Duress, Deliverance and if needed Duration and Distance. These generally will drain vitality or give affliction DR penalties in some way. Some are damaging and more physical as fire or poison, but many are more penalties that are temporary and their duration situational.
Some are to give much zeal and rabidness to their followers. Some are meant to frighten any dissidents. Some are actual elemental, chemical attacks to destroy enemies. In most cases, pageantry and a front of showmanship are used, to make the effect, the attack, that much more convincing.

A sorcerer is pulling the strings of any pagan activity. They will be well guarded by beastmen, barbarians or feral beasts ready to be unleashed. These could also be fed concoctions to give them more ferocity in some way.
Conversion: Sorcerers have sunk into the pits of evil, seeking influence and power. They must be stopped in order for conversion to occur for others. Only a miracle from the Lord could save these souls.

Shamans can range from local healers to chieftain advisors. Initially they will have some helpful ‘white’ magic that influences locals to give them more influence and power.
If a shaman uses Intellect, they may be more academic or a naturalist, like an herbalist or alchemist making concoctions to rule or manipulate others.
If they use their Society trait they will probably have a more advisory or leadership rule, using intimidation or social performance to control those around them.
Conversion: Shamans have sunk into the pits of evil, seeking influence and power. They must be stopped in order for conversion to occur for others. Only a miracle from the Lord could save these souls.

A fun and adventurous element that adds a fantasy flavor to the game is adding demonic and concoctive changes to warriors to make them more monstrous. There is some truth to this historically, especially in the vein of rabid or steroid-like and getting warriors to feel animalistic and fearless. This table provides some possibilities to add that extra level of challenge and scare. Remember, these are foul and given ritualistically! No Christian would partake!

Here yee will find the evil powers that wreak havoc among our attempts to spread the Gospel, establish churches and bring peace to the land.


NOTE: A separate supplement has listings of swarms, critters, creatures, beasts, villagers, cultists, witches & more!

Luke 22:35 Then Jesus asked them, “When I sent you out without purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?”
“Nothing,” they answered.
36 “Now, however,” He told them, “the one with a purse should take it, and likewise a bag; and the one without a sword should sell his cloak and buy one. 37 For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in Me: ‘And He was numbered with the transgressors. For what is written about Me is reaching its fulfillment.”
38 So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” “That is enough,” He answered.

VITALITY VS VIGOR	
For the confusion and the fun of it, both are used and both mean the same thing, representing hit point, stamina, exhaustion, pain, pangs, stress, endurance and how much one can take before collapsing in pain and/or exhaustion. Vigor is generally used for non-Christians, villainous characters and the beasts.

The Basic Chart	
The following page with the chart depicts the simplicity of creating adversaries. The listings are primarily focused on combat or violent threats. Other threats or roleplaying confrontations can be determined using the previous pagan info pages.
These pages are to give one villains and beasts for adventure, combat and fun. We can not deny the desire to be adventurous in our stories and to sometimes confront evil with the edge of a sword.
There is a separate supplement of creatures and villains, they are guides and not absolute. Each is a starting point to craft one’s own version or for simplicity sake to use as is.
The main thing to understand as a GM, is to make the enemies and foes somewhat comparable to the missionaries’ ability to defeat them. If the evil should be very powerful, which it can be, give fair warning, via the story, to missionaries before they try to confront or stop such enemies.
The chart shows the relative strengths of villains that one can use to quickly drum up any challenging foe.
Creature listings	
The goal is to have simple clear listings for creatures with their average trait, defense and armor save. There are listings for potential weapons and attacks. Only one should be used per turn unless there is a note or if the GM feels they can do more. Many will have one attack that could lead into another, like a charge and if successful it leads into a stomping or bite.
For beasts, their spirit trait is just a determination of their bravado, using each number as a die rank for any Denouement roll. Many creatures will not have all traits listed, that means those type of rolls will not come in to play. A Spirit of 1 or less means a d4 Denouement roll or susceptibility to evil spirits or possessions.

A common beast in the forest. It will flee if given the opportunity. It will charge if cornered, then flee. Any hunted can bring a fair bit of trade +d4. They can become susceptible to feral and evil curses that make them more dangerous.
Mark 5:2 As soon as Jesus got out of the boat, He was met by a man with an unclean spirit, who was coming from the tombs. 3 This man had been living in the tombs and could no longer be restrained, even with chains. 4 Though he was often bound with chains and shackles, he had broken the chains and shattered the shackles. Now there was no one with the strength to subdue him.

Most brutal beasts on four legs rely on their attacks overpowering their prey. Any brutal beast will generally behave this way.
•	Must have room to charge!
•	Fumbles on Nat1 and 2.
•	Can be shot at and attacked by anyone adjacent path of charge. If takes more damage than their Pro, they lose their charge & attack.
•	Attack bonus is +1DR to hit & +1DR to damage (increases damage die)
•	To hit result must be resisted with Pro or one is knocked down. One may add their armor save to this resist!
•	Charger, successful, gets a free trample, stomp immediately if they have it.
Inherent Traits	
Armor, Tough. Thick hide, scales, toughness, giantism. This adds a +1DR to their armor saves. Or it can affect their defense, like Tiny +2 to Defense.
Brute or Brutal +d#*. Beyond human strength, they will have a secondary die to damage. This means the die are added together as opposed to the normal ‘keep highest’. For example it will look like d12+d4*.
Camouflage. Many creatures in their environment will have natural stealth +DR.
Foul. Some creatures are so foul they may induce a poisonous affliction upon those near it. One may resist it with their Prowess or Spirit depending on the strength noted as the test number.
Giant. This creature is of unusual size and thusly awarded additional +1DR or more in certain traits like strength, damage, armor saves and/or fear. The Brute ability may apply.
Keen senses. Hearing. Sight. Smell. Any combination of these, when used, gives additional die ranks to sensing others.
Resistance or Resist. Some creatures have natural resistance to certain things, magic, rot, certain kinds of damage, some may be resistant to certain elements. This will be noted in each creature, like cold resistance. This is usually a die rank to resist or added to Armor Save.
Speed. These creatures are very fast and can catch humans easily. Consider their move to be two moves.
Weakness. Creatures may have a fear or weakness to something. A die rank penalty or doubling of damage dice may occur. The fear of fire is common to most creatures.
Unique abilities	
Bark or Roar. A loud cantankerous noise that alerts allies and can stun a target. This is against anyone in short range. Targets must resist using their Prowess or Spirit or be at -1DR or DRR fail for the encounter. Prowess of the creature +10 denotes the roar test number.
Feral or Demonic. These creatures are cursed or drugged by shamans and have become bloodthirsty beasts. They are made to attack one’s foes or released or set free in an area to wreak terror. They have the same stats as their natural selves but add an unholy +d4* to any aspect that the shaman or demonic influence has affected. They may have the Brute ability!
Lair. Many creatures in their environment will have gained natural die rank upgrades to their skills, like stealth and Prowess tests. Protecting their territory could enhance their innate skills.
Pack Attack. This creature tends to fight alongside others of its kind. They understand the advantage to attacking in numbers and gain 1DR to their to hit roll if an ally is adjacent.
Poison#. If this number of damage occurs after an armor save, then there is an additional poison attack or resist and effect.
Possessed Resistance: An unholy additional armor save die or resistance that can only be negated by holy attacks & exorcism.
Pounce. If a surprise is successful, these creatures gain die ranks to their attack and a following effect of either a knockdown or a grapple. If that is successful, the target is at -1DR penalty to escape and the prey gets +1DR to their next turn’s attack. The DR amount can be based off a noted skill or via DRR.
Submerged. Increases defense with +1DR difficulty, but spears avoid this penalty, being able to pierce through water. Submerged crossbows are also effective. Venomous. Some creatures have a poisonous attack. This will add extra damage as 1DR or more and could cause the Affliction or Restrained condition. One can do a Prowess or Spirit test to resist the condition and halve the venomous damage.

GM Sanctioned. GM’s should prepare beasts with any abilities that make the foe unique. Base it on die ranks and simple effects or defenses during an encounter.
A GM should not add a new ability in the middle of combat or encounter even if it is a good idea. This plays out the limits of creatures and their ways. It also allows players to find weaknesses without the concern of something ‘new’ countering their creative choices. Keep it simple. Use the new idea for the next adventure!
The same beasts could have different abilities, each having honed in on any of the above. Feel free to play with the factors and add abilities befitting the creature’s experience and environment or just to add flavor. But keep it simple and balanced.

Swarm Rules	
Smaller creatures will swarm to become a threat. Here are some basic rules for it.
1.	For every 1 critter, add their Vigor.
2.	For every ‘mound’ or unit of critter beyond the 1st
•	Add one die rank to hit & damage.
•	Add 1 die rank to any fear or effects if apropos.
3.	Weakness. All mobs take additional damage from area effect attacks like fire or stomping boots. Double the dice rolled for damage.
Once 2 foes fall, based on the vigor factor, remove the same in bonuses. Optionally reduce bonuses by half or thirds equal to the vigor damage. One can limit any size mobs’ bonuses to +5DR to hit and d12 damage or whatever one feels, limiting their effective ability against a single target.

These foul vermin tend to be around evil. Sacrificial areas and ruins will have a few vicious ones and may even have a swarm of them. A great starter challenge that can easily escalate. Vampiric bats can sneak up on sleeping humans and surreptitiously incise a small wound that will bleed as it laps up blood.

Crawling Within	
Critters have a chance to get into brigandine or plate armor. Instead of attacking the first turn, do a Prowess or Aware roll off, if they roll higher, critters have crawled inside the armor to attack. They now have the Armor Save as they bite within, avoiding the Armor Save of the wearer! Creepy!
Could roll a Fear test by the wearer! Hah! Panic!

•	Gnats, wasps, spiders
•	Smoke, Fire should repel them
These foul vermin tend to be around evil: sacrificial areas, ruins or haunted places. They certainly have things they avoid like fire, smoke, water, bright lights etc... They can be summoned or infest an area.
Swarm of Gnats
Meant to be more a nuisance, not causing damage as noted above but can cause foul rashes and nagging bites that could give a -d4 until cleansed and soothed.
Swarm of Wasps
These fly and thusly can chase after a group. Fire, smoke and water will affect them normally while weapons only do half damage.
Swarm of Spiders
Frightful crawling arachnids that come right out of the ground, coffins or walls to leap and crawl over anyone. It may be difficult to hit them when they are on one’s own body? Half damage to them and half to oneself if struck? Rolling Prowess with rolling, smacking should do d6, damage or so if any are actually hit. If missed, the victim may lose 1 vitality them self due to exhaustive flailing.

Deer are wide spread and valuable food source for beasts and man. There is a wide variety of kinds with weaknesses and strengths. Noted here is an average deer. They can do a short burst horn attack, or if able, can charge increasing damage and possibly causing a fall which they can then stampede over. For larger beasts upgrade Prowess, Defense, Vigor, damage accordingly.

Wolves are a bane in ole dark Europe, especially in the forests and mountains. They won’t attack unless they can successfully set an ambush. If exposed or attacked before they ambush, they will likely flee.
This is the basic wolf stats, there can be a variety of wolf kinds, especially bigger and more terrifying ones.

Varieties of more dangerous wolves can exist in the Dark Ages. Rare, large, more ferocious versions can be utilized to create ‘devil dogs’ and fear amongst locals. Their eyes reflect torches, they can have darker fur, have more cunning, something to be rooted out by those willing to risk their lives to save others. These could also be trained by pagans to hunt farmers or lone travelers especially at night!

•	Lionesses +5 attacks but have Pack Attack +1DR
These are comparable to the bear as a predatory threat. Speed, stealth and lionesses, who hunt as a pack, certainly make them a bigger threat in warmer regions. In colder areas, the lions are more solitary and tiger like.

Knockdown Rule
•	To hit result must be resisted with Pro or one is knocked down. One may add their armor save to this resist!

This network of town thieves will try to steal valuables off any newcomers. They may even be in liege with the town guards. There could be several, one distracting while the other steals. They will avoid fighting unless cornered.
Farmers have various dispositions, based on local pagan attitudes. But they are used to drum up support as mobs and can be a threat if enough gather and have a strong pagan leader.
Conversion: They are focused on their job and may fear their boss more than a preacher or his word. Deal with the boss to really get to them. They can have an average CL roll, but again, they will fear whomever has told them what to do. If converted, they will return any items stolen, as long as they are not edible.

	RolePlaying	
Many encounters, especially in civilized areas, will not require one to have a fully created character. These are meant to be dealt with in a role-playing manner.
Pick a few skills or areas they’d have a +2 or +4 trait and skills at +1DRor +2DR. These can be impromptu, immediately assigning it for the first roll the players want to do against them.
Give them secondary knowledge or skills where they will have a +1 or +2 at, and maybe a +1DR. Again, as the GM assign the next series of rolls these skills. Most locals will utilize their skills and only their skills, ignoring or moving along if the encounter isn’t akin to their business or daily routines.
If they are in the element or have a militia behind them, you might want to add a DR or two and give them +3DR or +4DR to intimidate or rebuff or control crowds. If they are in their fancy shop and have busy workers all around them or have their best dress on, they may get that DR bonus.
Entering a great hall with advisors and servants all around, will give a local Duke some pomp and royal bonuses that one must overcome to persuade, convince or get on one’s side.
What missionaries must do is figure out how to gain more appeal to the Duke, to the locals. Each individual will have an agenda, some fun quirks or attitudes the GM should play off. Have fun as the GM, getting to act these roles, giving them outward attitudes and secret agendas. Allow them to be flustered, angry, giving away clues or to be distant, cold, calculating and conniving a plot against the saints.
Generally, the setting of this game, have a pagan leader amidst the settlement. This magician or witch will have sought to either climb the ranks to advisor or personal healer or sage to the Duke or whoever is in charge. So these will be counter forces to the Christian momentum.
When missionaries can accomplish tasks, adventurous challenges that either weaken a plot or rescue those in dour situations, things can change. But until they prove themselves, most locals will be adverse and stubborn to change or evangelism. They will have more connection with their local pagan leader than any new missionaries.
Christians can certainly try to go in and straight away attempt evangelism. It should be harder with many being suspicious of this new monotheism coming in to change their traditions and ways.

Captain Jerkhouen and his militia travel the roads to the next campaign. Stay out of their way! They may take whatever foods or items they deem necessary for supplies! Hopefully the Christians will not pray in earnest, causing the Captain to suffer some event that then makes them hastily return the confiscated items and beg forgiveness!
The merchants of any village are in the know, concerning pagan plots of advantage over others, wanting life cheats when it comes to success and materialism. But most may have a chance to seek forgiveness if their greedy world is upturned, their plots exposed as evil. But until then, they will scorn, mock, scoff and tut-tut any challenge to their worldview.
Reminder: Conversion shouldn’t really have a chance at success until after some important factor has been removed, or a dire, violent situation has been overcome!
Concerning blasphemy	
I, StorytellingRon, don’t consider it blasphemy to mock or counter the role-playing of evangelism in this game. The pagans would and should mock and scoff at what the players say in evangelism. However, as the GM, playing the pagans, one should keep it more PG or PG13... with the mocking having limits and being in the form of mocking questions that the players can respond to and literally work out their evangelism.
A GM should certainly be careful and the best way is to limit the mocking to one or two odd comments. Defiant witches and angry mobs will certainly say foul things and one can act out the fun, family parts and then describe it when it gets more bitter and contentious.

Dressing as beasts and living like them, they seem to have changed their physical form. Some would say they truly are beasts! They have turned to torture and cannibalism and can be found serving pagan cults, shamans and witches.
Conversion: Too far gone, having consorted with witches & demons, only through pure defeat and violent submission may some survivors be given the chance to see their power as fragile. They are at CL1!
Pagans will use some sort of altar or location to perform rituals and give sacrifices. This will generally be the focus of their power and fanaticism. They will defend it, though not always to the death. Some may hesitate or surrender and see if the altar or idol itself will stop or punish any Christians who attempt to knock it down or demolish it.
These altars, shrines, cairns, markers or other sites are central to the pagan plots and should be the climatic turning point of each session. These spots could also reveal any dispensing of concoctions to beasts or what criminal grift is occurring.
Locals will fear the spot to the point of not wanting to reveal the location, hiding it from any inquiry or interrogation. Locals will certainly fear any retribution if the sacred spots are destroyed.
 
 The Horned Ones Kult 
A cult of mongrels who have resorted to primal behaviors. They hunt and sacrifice the local deer population for their weapons, hides and ‘horns’. They build altars and encase their strongest human sacrifices inside a large ‘demonic’ form to worship and instill fear amongst the rest.
They are mercurial in nature, working under greater more civilized leaders who craft their Ancient Horned One leader and set up whatever scheme they want. It usually involves slaves, mining or any other laborious operation. The local leaders look the other way and take the profit.
A sorcerer is usually the contact between these and any duke or merchant in business with them.

The Horned Ones are given fervor and fear by their leader. They cover themselves in antler, bones and deer hide. They prefer stealth, ambush and fear to overcome enemies and poor villagers. They are slavers of the weak and use them for whatever purpose they have in the forests and mines.
Conversion: These are at CL1... But if denouement is at play, they will raise to CL4! The Horned Ones are fortunately the youngest and most foolish of the fanatics so there is some chance to break them down and change their dark hearts.

A larger horned one leading the others. Could be guarding an area or entrance. They are not leaders so much as brutes used to encourage the smaller ones or to keep them in line.
Conversion: Oddly some could be converted. They are big and burly and are given the role of scary security. Some could be very cruel and brutal, wanting to only impress their master. They are at CL1! But food may be a factor in conversion! Especially rich foods.
The goal isn’t always to vanquish the ones who cause fear and terror, but perhaps, getting them to surrender. There is still hope to save them. One can gain new allies and saved souls to help plant, build and grow the church. And whilst one moves on, they remain to protect the growing parish.

Either the shaman possessed commands the cultists or being dead, an evil spirit controls it and leads the Horned Ones. It sits at an altar, appearing part of it until it is disturbed by Christians nearby. Then it will rise and destroy any followers of Christ.

Large reptilian beasts have limits to where they can thrive. The large swathes of warm regions are ever being encroached by men and their desire for comforts.

Possessed, poisoned and/or bred this way, these bears are stronger and madder than regular bears. They may have a mission or are so rabid they will attack anyone on site. Hags who raise these can train them, usually with addictive concoctions to target victims, especially those ‘marked’ by the hag with a curse (secretly applying their concoction). Some can be downright possessed and more powerful.

A wolf grown to large size and ferocious could be viewed as part man. These have the habit of rearing up on their hind legs to instill fear. Or is it some man, turned to beast and driven mad? Or is it a demon, possessing man or beast and carrying out evil deeds?

	Cavefolk, Dark Dwellers	
These savage folk have secluded themselves into dark remote caves and worship the dark shadows that play upon their cave walls. They are simple and rustic, disregarding the outside world, except to steal or murder in the darkest of nights.
Some might believe them to be kobolds or goblins, eerie malnourished gangly creatures who hide in the shadows.
They can be converted but with much difficulty and probably with some propensity to violence to subdue their dark evil upbringing.
Their witch certainly seduces them with dark tales around a cave fire, creating shadows on the wall and performing rituals thereof to keep them in the dark.
Fight in the Dark
First, roll the cavefolks stealth in the dark to create a difficulty the missionaries must overcome to even sense them. Also attacking them in the dark for this setting is at -5DR, but the DRR of that roll may reduce that by die ranks. So if a holy knight rolls above their stealth total he will sense them. And based on how much he succeeds at hearing or sensing the cavefolk the normal -5DR rolls in the dark can be reduced by the DRR.

Choking Dust, she can puff or spew out dust that can chokes anyone in the area. Does damage.
Shadowy Fears, she can create a sense of demonic shadows and sounds that instill fear. A Spi12 resist is the default or one wants to rush out of there or at
-DR to rolls. No duration is required by her, the only release being to get out of the dark shadowy caves. Not even fire will do it, since it is still in a scary shadowy place.
Dark Ritual, she performs shadowy stories and dances to keep them as dark cave dwelling zealots. They have senses in the dark and have a +DRR to their denouement! This is also done in preparation for moonless night raids.

Forest nymphs, faeries and trolls are pagans who relish the forest and the capability of hiding in it for stealth and ambush. They consider themselves part of the forest spirits and act accordingly. They attempt to cause fear at a distance, making anyone without courage feel a panic induced fear due to their creepy camouflaged movements.
Drugs, rituals and other mind and spirit altering zealotry have lead these to believe they are one with the forest, the protectors, the servants or what have you.
Non-believers are prime targets for expulsion or sacrifice.
They will have a witch or sorcerer as their leader and crafter of any poisons made from forest ingredients. Not all nymphs necessarily live in the forest. These may be local farmers,villagers or leaders who have some motive to control or keep their forest land for their own benefit. Some may have somewhat innocent or innocuous intentions, while others may be quite devious.
For the more insidious they will have ingredients gathered from the local forest. A source of mushrooms could give them powers or ritual enhancements. Some root may have the poisonous or healing effects they wish to covet for themselves. A powerful ingredient the witch wishes to keep Savret may be the at the center of this group. It could also be a ruin or treasure or other valuable site.

These trolls are not the giant trolls but are cult warriors adorned with garb to look and make them feel like forest trolls. They are zealot warriors whose large bulky headdresses make them feel invulnerable and thusly a bit more fanatical.
Getting into the roles, they’ll grunt and growl and otherwise seem to lose their sanity for the role. Some may be warriors, some may be old power hungry losers, it will be a difficult task for the missionaries to subdue and discern.

These festooned characters are bigger, stronger and more crazed warriors, feeling their strength come from such awkward adornments. Their lifts and masks cover them like a shield and helm and add a frightening look against any cowardly foe.
They over swing and stomp about hollering and howling, causing fear into anyone without the Spirit. They are used by the witches for their rituals, to reinforce their tyranny over others by guarding and participating.

The Bite Curse is rumored to make one turn into a wolf. Generally the victim is diseased and could die from it. If one survives, in their delirium they are given ‘medicines’ by the shaman and rituals to turn them into wolfmen. This is a ritualistic, rite of passage for their warriors.
The ritual weakens the will of the sick and feeble minded. It can feed into the anger of those full of rage, promising them violent power!
During combat, if a wolfman doe bite a victim, it will take them out of the fight for d4 turns. It generally only does this if other warriors are fighting.

Dressing as wolves and behaving thusly, they seem to have changed their physical form. Some would say they truly are wolves! They are empowered by rituals and war dances.
Conversion: Too far gone, having consorted with witches & demons, only through pure defeat and violent submission may some survivors of their own violence be given the chance to see their power as fragile.
This culture of warriors use lycanthrope as their tool, their secret weapon of fear to conquer and enslave others. They will have villages with trappings of wolf heads, fur, claws and more. They will have plenty of slaves and show much contempt for any outsiders. It would seem the men, women and children are enthralled to their culture of the wolf.

	Woodelf, woodfolk, forestfolk	
This cult tribe is... woody. They love wood! Well they like forests and nymph like things. They could be in tandem with or warriors of the nymph types or have their own backwood tribe. They could be normal, but during rituals or for battle, dress up like this.
They’re goal is to be frightening and stick to a theme. They could have normal weapons but also crazy primitive wood, bone and stone ones. These folks have hidden away in the dark forests of the Tuetoberg and have gone fully wild, primitive, barbaric or deceptively genius.
Others fear these forests and/or avoid these crazies and that is the way they like it. They are pagan and will have some dark oppressive religious beliefs.
Forest cover and stealth	
All woodfolk get a +d6 to stealth and for defense when not in combat or at melee range. They can also use +d6 for maneuvering in forests, tracking, noticing things, hunting and gathering. (However we Christians do not believe in the hunter/gatherer theory!)
If they succeed at stealth, they can charge or snipe and get a +d4 to attack and damage on the first attack.

The Skull Kult can be any cult group in any area. They can be living in remote desolate lands, in swamps on isolated isles or in the heart of a town or city! They can be an agrarian cult that desires better harvest and livestock or a merchant cult who seeks to undermine other business with unfair pagan practices.
Whatever the case, the Skull Kult can be used as a far reaching religion that has taken on the mantle of underground pagan worship adverse to the Church and the new ways. It’s source can be slavic or ancient Greek coming from the isle of Crete where the minotaur once reigned.
If the members are the merchants, farmers and businessmen, the warriors will be their hired hands or hired goons to protect them during these gatherings.

Roll a DRR preparation before hand, wherein the result can be saved as additional intensity to resist, penalty, pain for fire damage to any ‘magical’ attack ‘cast’ from above list.
Scarification, this ritual will heal any fire wounds, but will certainly make the afflicted flesh quite ugly and scarred. There’s a good chance this was used on the magician himself!
Fire resistance, a preparation done for a leader or warrior, giving them some resistance to this magician’s powers. The purpose being they can fight as the magician casts fire attacks.

Roman patricians would place dead Roman soldiers in their crypts and tombs as guards. They were Roman soldiers who died in battle and bought as corpses. Now they can easily be possessed by demonic spirits to hinder any Christian meddling and encourage pagan worship. They fight until their Vigor reaches 0 or less.

Conversion: Too far gone, have consorted with base demons and are mentally more animal. This is also a game mechanic consideration, to avoid converting and having giants as allies or players. This may make the game an unbalanced or too fantastical.

These primordial gorillas are the epitome of horrific monstrous demons that can be lurking in remote caves and catacombs. If fed well, they can become, not tamed, but manageable. But only to pagans who willingly sacrifice others and bow submissively to the unhinged rage of such wild beasts.

Add unholy d4 to armor, damage and will fight to the death.

Add +d10 to vigor, +d4 to damage and will fight to the death
Witches or local shamans may tame or train such beasts to become their demonic entity. Or they may leave bait out that will cause such conditions.
To assess the threat of using these, have the patriarch be a final boss whilst some younger ‘bachelor’ males are wondering the perimeter of the area as random frustrated beasts. The females and pups will be hidden away and flee if the patriarch is killed.

	PitsandTrapfalls	
Tomb or lair Traps
Pitfalls, stone drops, poison release and so forth.
•	Awa/Sav12 to notice a trap or dangerous terrain.
•	Searching an area, by default, automatically finds it.
•	Pro/Awa/Sav12 to avoid, leap, duck based on situation
•	Sav/Int12 to understand, describe & disarm
•	If fail, starts as 1DR damage & half that for grievous wound after an armor save.
•	If poison or disease, another Pro/Spi12 roll to resist or become afflicted. DRR by default. Or predetermined.
•	May transfer affliction or grievous wound to armor, as wear & tear. (poisoned/diseased armor is fouled)
 Pit and Trapfall
1.	Tunnel Descent
2.	Well or Pit
3.	Chasm
4.	Pit Trap
5.	Barred, locked door
6.	Collapsing floor or ceiling
7.	Small trigger trap, dart or crossbow
8.	Dead fall trap, trigger

Damage die roll should be same as DRR fail die.

	Damage	
1.	Vitality, exhaustion, frustration
2.	Vitality, exhaustion, frustration
3.	Wear & tear, specific to climbing
4.	Wear & tear, armor or clothes
5.	Wear & tear, random gear
6.	Half vitality, half painful wound
7.	Half vitality, half armor
8.	Grievous wound or affliction!


Tunnel Descent	
Test to descend. DRs to make it harder: distance, slick walls, very steep and so on. Roll total DR and add to 12.
Failures by DRR determine vitality drain, damage to gear, takes longer, a roll of Nat1 could be a dropped item or weapon, and/or penalty die for a short while.
If one should fail by more than 12 or 6DRs, the 6th could be a 1DR grievous wound on top of the first 5DR. Or fail by 16 or 8DRs could be 5DR (d12) vitality drain and a -3DR ankle sprain!
Vitality drain is the simplest, then wear & tear of some gear, then wounds, or affliction (if poison or festering element).

A Dungeon Well or Pit	
Murky water in the depths or a pit for prisoners moaning in horrible pain. Rats crawling about in either, littered with bones and filth.
It could be a summoning pit for dark shadows and evil spirits! Or a passageway leading straight down! This will have many purposes, hopefully all dark and foreboding.
Generally easy to climb down with traversing gear. It was made for a purpose. Whether that purpose or something far more sinister is happening must be decided.
1.	Festering water well
2.	Vermin infested well, sewage like
3.	Good clean mineral water, +1DR use in heal, cooking! Can carry d4 worth in any container.
4.	Dried and leads to tunnels below, fear factor, but a good way deeper!
5.	So deep as to be mysterious. Primordial wyrm beast hibernates far below! Having dug up from the underworld!
6.	Haunted, a demonic presence or ghost resides there! Used by local pagans in worship. Can be cleansed with holy battle and prayer!
 
A Dark Chasm	
In a shadowy passageway, just around a corner or barely visible alongside a path, a dangerous misstep and one falls who knows how far? So not obvious! Roll an Awa to spot it. Die Rank factors to increase the Awa12 to spot: around a corner, dark, a distracting feature above, being chased & so on.
Factors to help: cautious, light source. Immediate success: looking down for such things.
If one fails, they fall and must make a Pro save! It can be a random damage and DRR or predetermined.

Small Trigger Trap, Projectile	
didn’t write anything for this, i just discovered, making this for AI... huh!

Pit Traps	
Hidden under stone or forest floors, these traps are simple and common, but they are intentionally hidden! So it would require an Awa12 to spot and avoid. A Sav12 to disarm without triggering it. If aware and it is still triggered, only roll to avoid a Nat1!
The GM should roll have any in the front roll, stating a basic awarness roll for the area or for a better description or any deceptive means to get them to roll! If they actually search, it could be an instant spot &avoid and an easy disarm, depending on the sophistication intended.
Falling is a d6 + d6 or more for the spikes. Some may be poisoned garnering such based on a certain amount of damage inflected. They should be difficult to climb out of, especially if wounded or under attack.
So a difficulty of 12 to climb out normally!
But it’s probably treacherous terrain, so that would be an extra DR or their armor save! And if under attack, smooth walls or more, each could add a DR to the total DR roll to add to the 12 difficulty!
Dead Fall Trap	
Similar to pit traps, these however fall from the ceiling or roof. They might have added hidden bonuses since few look up or notice things above them. Have it make sense, a post, frame or support of some kind with gravity and weight bearing down all work to create a deadly dead fall!
A GM can determine the difficulty to spot and avoid, starting with 12 and adding DRs based on whatever factor deems plausible. Wide area, heavy rocks, well hidden could all add a DR, to then roll and add to the 12. If one triggers the deadfall, tripping a thin rope, standing on a plate or removing a treasured item, whatever it is, it

Tomb Door	
These barred or locked doors will have TR12 or more locks or bars on the other side. If barred, an armor save of d10 with 40 structural points. Axes have a armor piercing quality on wood, let’s say, of 5.
Perhaps a trap has also been placed?!

Collapsing Floor or Ceiling	
Whether old and decrepit or set as a trap, this floor or ceiling will collapse or has collapsed. One might notice if it’s a false floor or if it’s already collapsed. Use the same difficulty to avoid falling! A d6 to d12 fall damage and a bit extra for the rocks falling with thee!


Adding sophistication	
Any one of these could include added sophistication. One could add DRs to detection, the roll to avoid, to damage and more. These DRs should be determined ahead of time and rolled, making the trap more deadly. Tribes certainly sat around devising better defenses based on the terrain and structures available.
They should make sense to what is there, the setting and materials used.
 
	Altars,shrines,tombs	
Fires	
A simple fire at a campsite or a brazier with coals can be a sacrificial altar. Bones and burnt items could be found there. The type based on the family friendly setting of course! Animals being the most prevalent. Offerings to their gods. Dark shadows and fiery visions are to be had for rituals and summonings.
These are commonly placed in front of other altars, giving pageantry and illusion with flame and light. It would not be surprising if a witch will have flammable dusts or liquids to toss in, influencing followers and distracting missionaries.
Tomb	
burial, catacomb, cinerarium, crypt, grave, mausoleum, sepulcher, sepulture, vault
Pagans worship their ancestors and will have built and secured rich ones with traps and demonic curses. Treasures from these could easily fund a church plant and strengthen it.
Many Christian tombs are important, having relics and sacred items. These could be vandalized, taken over or destroyed, needing the Church to investigate.

More Esoteric Shrines	
Thematic and ornately done shrines are prevalent amongst the magicians and witches. They use these to impress upon their followers. While the rules do not overtly claim shrines to be essential, they can be. A shrine can be a source of magic points, DR bonuses and more, anything the GM sees fit as giving power and influence to the pagan leader.

Stones, megaliths	
Placed as spots along roads or in a henge circle, these are very common for pagans and can be stopping points or meeting places. Rituals and offerings are done here. Singular stones being wayside traveling spots while stonehenges are meeting circles where rituals are performed.

Crude Altar or Shrine	
A common altar will be made of wood, whether structural or a totem or a figure. These are used to place offerings in front of and can influence followers, giving them DR bonuses to denouement or any other based on the ritual.
These are essential and focus points for pagan power. Destroying them will affect the denouement of followers and the focus of the pagan witches and sorcerers.



Demonic scary altars	
For a final showdown in some epic campaign to rid the land of pagan worship and whoever led this from some secret place, one can create a demonic altar run by a pagan leader who definitely knows what they are getting into. Whether a sorcerer type or a witch, they will have significant demonic powers and their focus of extra
powers will come from this altar. It can be an evil entity, having some of its own abilities to hinder, frighten and/or curse the missionaries! Its destruction will be part of the dramatic conclusion!
 



The main catacombs of history tend to be Christian, however many have been lost to time, taken over & desecrated by pagans or rebuilt as pagan shrines and temples.
So there will be a mixture of pagan and Christian in the maze of spaces but the controlling factions will be pagan. Any Christian location will have been desecrated, hopefully leaving some clues of its past or warnings to help the missionaries.
The general goal of penetrating these underworld networks is to clear them out of all paganism, cleaning out the desecration and consecrating the holy sites once again. Many of the pagan ones may be so wretched that nothing but total destruction and sealing will do. It will require all altars and shrines to demonic powers be destroyed. The level of intensity, fun and mayhem could add demonic, monstrous forces. This style of Christian RPG is meant more for classic RPG style gaming and adds flavor to a game so that it isn’t always above ground evangelism and church planting. Obviously those are the main themes of the game, but it is definitely fun to have some dark dungeon delving diversions!
Catacombs are more expansive than we realize, miles of them run under Rome and many other major Dark Age cities. Most were constructed before the 7th century. They were ‘mysteriously’ sealed off until the 17th century or so, when they were rediscovered! A great story concept is to then wonder why the Church sealed off the catacombs. An obvious answer is that once Christianity was fully accepted, there was no need to hide or bury Christians under the cities. Cemeteries outside the cities could be legally utilized.
A fun way of looking at it, is that the catacombs beyond the Christian burial sites, became filled with evil pagan worshipers who went underground and defiled and desecrated the sites and dug further, opening up darker regions and summoning gates! This required Christian knights and clergy to go down and clear them out. They then had to seal them, hiding or imprisoning whatever evil lurked there!
So, for the Dark Ages dungeon delving, we shall generally go with the fantastical latter and not the former!

Deeper, Deeper Story
The proceeding tables are based on the DR system. So the +1DR refers to the die used getting upgraded. It starts at d4... to get to d12. The GM should prepare some of it ahead of time. The generic stats of worshipers, zealots, guards, thieves and leaders should be at hand. They are available in this book. The theme of each area can be unique. Once a major pagan group is thwarted, cleared out... This part of the catacomb is sealed off.
Most entrances will be below a church, in their crypt or tombs! Each church is assigned to protect the seal!

Use the following tables as guides, random generators or a pathway into the catacombs. The DR is a way of starting with a d4, then as you roll, +1DR will accrue to make it have a chance of getting more and more severe. The journey down should be long and arduous, and things like rations, torch kit and lantern and oil should be carefully logged.
To put it simply, each may get the LOW tag if there is a fumble or something on the chart marks it so. If it is already LOW, then it shall become expended! There will be ways to replenish these in the catacombs, plenty of pilgrims and pagans have left offerings or supplies in the dark, if they can be found!


Random Encounters. Roll the same die as the Parts roll, on a 4+ use the Random Encounters table.

2.	Slaves present, performing tasks, cleaning, gathering offerings. Roll conversion level for who they serve. Religiously loyal. Very resistant to leading them to Major Setting!
3.	Offerings are still present. Low salvage.
4.	Mourners and offerings here. Deep conversations! Minimal chance for violence. A conversion can garner Inspired Die based off DRR conversion.
5.	Worshipers or pilgrims. Random conversion level!
6.	Zealots, attendees for a cult are here for preparations. Very resistant! Roll two d8, pick lowest for conversion. Not violent unless attempt at conversion or notice of desecration of pagan shrines.

Mining stone around may be easier: Saved12, Hull14, but requires at least 4 parts to open up area. Very loud, very messy and every roll is about 20mins of work and any armor save that reduces to 0 damages gear by -1DR, except pickax. A key can be gained if salvage in any area nearby garners a special find. Since they are now looking for a key.

	Major Setting	

When they stumble upon an area that the pagans have fortified as their own underground site, roll here for the build up of the opposition. Use the Hexen Crawl, to determine their major plot contrivances and why they are here.
Roll d12 on Deeper, Deeper Story, rolling a few times to get the major rooms in the area, utilized for worship. Assume mundane servant, clerical and security rooms along with storage supplies. All other results are extravagant, fortified and have salvage.
Roll d12 for guards, double that for slaves, triple that for zealots, followers.
Treat the slaves as mobs that will generally not resort to violence. Their conversion level is a base d8. They could go either way and are certainly more susceptible to conversion.
The zealots are more resistant and will resort to violence only if their leader or idols are threatened. Treat them as a mob, using simple mob attack.
Mob attack: Add 1DR per unit, upto 5. That is the attack and damage DR. Each vigor factor of 6 or 8 reduces that group by 1 DR if it takes that amount. Keep it that simple. They attack with daggers, stones, clubs.
Have an oppressor ready, a priestess, sorcerer, conjurer one prepared or use one listed here.











desecrate, sacrilegious, unholy, blasphemous, profane, godless, pervert, defile, befoul, violate, dishonor, disgrace
 
 Treasure, Relics, Artifacts... 
This is for main singular locations that will have loot, salvage, offerings, treasure! USE DRR method thusly:
Each missionary can roll to search the area, to garner what is there, using a trait they pick, describing why and how they use that trait. The GM can add bonus DRs to the roll if it is apropos, and/or based on the area or story. An area could have designated treasure based off location or story that will be there no matter the roll.
1.	pouch of denarri, d10 x d20
2.	sack of denarri, d20 x d20
3.	local stolen goods, 1 heavy or 2 medium
4.	local stolen resources, cart worth
5.	local merchant goods, cart worth
6.	local lordly item, medium, +4DR social
7.	local royal, heavy, +5DR social
8.	chest of coins, d6 x 100, 1 heavy
9.	ancient Roman item or weapon, a +1DR item
10.	ancient Pagan item, heavy
11.	Roman relic, medium
12.	Saintly relic, light
•	Ancient Roman weapons are superior. If the die roll has a dice pool, the GM could convert any additional die into die ranks and add to the bonus and style upgrades of the weapon. It should not go above a 3DR in one upgrade! Generally speaking!
•	Ancient Pagan items are only wanted by pagan forces, whether human or not! Story element! If shown to locals and destroyed, could help with conversion.
•	Roman Relics are items desired by local Lords, Royalty, and the Church whether for wealth or study. They can be exchanged for Writs, Permissions, Titles by local dukes and financial gain for the support of the Church.
•	Saintly Relics, if known or studied by the Church can be blessings for missionaries. They can offer a mild bonus, like 1DR to one aspect of the clergy or paladin. Perhaps it gives 1DR whenever Bless, Heal or Glory is used. Or it gives 1DR to the Spirit roll to resist fear. It should be specific in what it offers. To keep safe, they are a medium burden. They can be a bone, scroll, tome, ashes, letter, parts of scripture, wood from the Cross, humble ornament, and so forth. While true Christianity does not believe in ‘holy relics’ it is undeniably part of historical practices. They could be considered mementos that the saints hold onto for courage and support. Each missionary shouldn’t have more than one relic. If given to a local church it can be used as a holy relic that helps draw pagans for evangelism. It will also be considered a major church support and the missionaries gain a glory point. One can certainly forgo this aspect of the game, having relics which seem merely like magic items. If used, should be used lightly and the focus should be on the person’s own faith and perseverance.

Mundane Findings of Usefulness	
Use the DRR as DRs worth for using as bonus die and roll it for what is found:
1.	Local loot, trinkets, oddities found, can be used for the local church, for trade, for persuasion of locals only. Could be from offerings or stolen and could be used to return to locals.
2.	Local information garnered, from signs, scrolls, parchments, trinkets, insignias on tattered cloth, pagan sculptures, rune markings and so forth
3.	Twine n nails to repair gear
4.	Traversing gear specific to the area, perhaps already set in place or made of local, degradable materials, may be used as a bonus for this area only
5.	Local resources for trade, useful to locals in their daily usage, a clay, inks from something, poor quality ore, weaving, building materials and so forth.

 What’s a DRR again??? 


A DRR is the number above the difficulty to search, usually a 12, that is then halved. This is the DR which is converted to the die that one rolls for a result. If it is a dice pool, use the secondary dice to add more to the amount.
We also use DRs as consumables. So 5DR of gear repair, can be used, like inspired die, to aid in gear repair.
So if using Mundane Findings of Usefulness table a missionary rolls a 22 of a default 12, thusly a DRR of 10, halved is 5 which is 5DRs... roll d12 on the table, and also get 5DRs worth of whatever is rolled.
 
  the one shot or minishot 
This section highlights a way to create a one shot or short gaming experience for an evening of play or over a few sessions. The players characters will gain glory points and spend them as they go along. It is intended for quick adventures, pre-made characters and quick upgrades to a fun finale against a big boss or event.
Searching through a catacomb for a main event is a good way to use this one shot method. It is advisable to have the tomb and map prepared ahead of time and the encounters kept as the first small intro encounter, a tougher encounter, that then leads to the main event. In between can be some exploration and salvage amongst various rooms. All of these are done to try and upgrade the missionaries combat and blessings for the finale.
There can also be one or two evangelism encounters with pagans who are in the catacombs or dark forest visiting ancestral burial sites or as pilgrims heading to a temple. If converted, this will act as a salvage reward.
Some pre-made characters are provided in the following pages as archetypes to start. They could be given a first time d12 roll for extra glory points to start!

Glory Points Gained	
In addiction to salvage glory points, each member of a missionary group will gain glory points each for the following.
•	Defeating foes.
•	Converting any foes not killed, as a group.
•	Converting any pilgrims or pagans that are separate encounters.
The GM will decide a DR for a glory point roll, based on the challenge, how well they roleplayed, and/or how high the die rolls were. Use the Denouement class listing in the Combat Section as a way to decide.

Treasure Hunting	
When searching about for salvage, each missionary gets to roll, picking their trait and any skill that is apropos. It isn’t just about ‘treasure hunting’. There is discernment in what is to be found and why. Missionaries are looking to cleanse and purify the area and any treasure gained will be to the support of the cause.
So the table of salvage represents searching each area and clearing it of pagan desecrations, gathering up anything valuable for the Church finances & charity and giving each missionary a sense of holy accomplishment.
All of this is to build up the missionaries for a finale with the central pagan boss or gathering, to purge this area of a pagan stronghold!
Main Table of Quick Gains	
1. +1 inspired die, cleared out pagan trinkets
2. d4 inspired die, cleared out a pagan ritual space, symbols, sculptures
3. 1 glory point, pagan idol found, destroyed
4. 1 glory point, 1 inspired die, idol & space cleared out
5. 2 glory points, Christian momentos found, cleared of pagan defilement
6.1	glory point, d6 DR worth of healing supplies
7.1	glory points, d6 DR worth of armor repair supplies
8.	3 glory points, recovered a saintly memento, writing, artifact
9.	4 glory points, recovered a known Church artifact, cross, emblem, banner, relic
10.	Master crafted weapon or gear +3DR, split anyway, replaces what one has AND one major factor is improved d6: 1-One Less Burden, 2-Crushing is 18(minimum), 3-item +1, 4-less 1 on Lethal, 5-less 1 on Bleed, 6-something the player senses!
11.	Saintly relic, add 1DR* HOLY to any weapon as holy damage, or if item, adds to Faith Point bonus as separate HOLY die or can add to preaching or praying as separate HOLY die.
12.	Roll on Saintly Relics table, in the Treasure section.
Any secondary die, use below!
If their salvage roll is high enough to garner 6DR or more, use the additional die below.

These are rolled here, based on the trait used.

 DarkEvilGrimEncounterTable 
This is all the creature listings in their generalized groupings.
1.	Vermin, swarm

16.	Cursed mysterious encounter
17.	Ogre, Troll
18.	Giant
19.	Fantastical, Primordial Beast!
20.	Demons!!!!
These tables are another guide for creating one’s own setting or for encounters, utilizing a DR type upgrade as in the Catacomb and Dungeon Crawl Experience sections at the end of this book. Start with 1DR as a d4, then upgrade and go up to d12.
Also, this can be used for missionaries wanting to have a more random, traveling adventure, looking for souls to save in more ways than one.
The intention of the Dark Ages setting is more established lands and settlements that the missionaries go to, but one could derive a ‘random’ hex crawl type situation, in the vast Germanic Black Forest or the Tuetoburg Forest or along the countryside of any area.
Missionaries could seek souls in these areas and start something of a hex campaign. The main souls to save would be the actual pagan cults one finds in the random tables!
The conversion level of these would generally be {d8,d8}keep the lowest!

	Main Table	

Basic encounters for random settings, generally in wilderness or away from settlements.
1.	Vermin, swarm
2.	Natural animal, creepy
3.	Natural beast, feral
4.	Ruffians, brigands, bandits
5.	Cultist warriors, beastmen, barbarians
6.	Elite cult zealots, major figure
7.	Minor dragon beast
8.	Major dragon beast
9.	Kraken, coastal beast, giant crabs
10.	Primordial beast
11.	Demonic possessed, feral, rabid beast
12.	Use The Plot Thickens Table
 
	Plot Thickens	
These are tied to more fears and trepidations locals will have over an area or pagan activity.

1.	Use Main table, but double amount in area, or if a major beast, add younger or hungry hostile scavengers
2.	Cults, organized, deceptive, cultured, with minor witch, sorcerer
3.	Witches
4.	Elite organized, powerful cults, skilled
5.	Warlock, Sorcerer, Magician
6.	Cursed mysterious encounter
7.	Ogre, Troll
8.	Giant
9.	Cults, organized, deceptive, cultured, with a coven or very established sorcerer
10.	Fantastical Primordial Beast!
11.	Demons!!!!
12.	Reroll here twice, adding both! If this rolled again, add a third and so forth.


easy modular map pieces
Notable signs to follow, the old dead tree, the fallen tree. Could be fallen to block the road!
Roll axe or chop wood skill wouldn’t be success or fail as much as how long and any fail against a 12 would be the difference halved. That would be the DR damage to their weapon OR vitality drain from tiring and it would take awhile.



Going through the forest would have treacherous terrain tests, where failure is the draining of vitality, wear & tear of gear, and/or delay in time!




A crude totem or shrine, decked with thematic accessories, usually in the vein of bones, dead animals, trinkets and the like. It will be considered sacred and definitely add to their morale, resist and denouement. It could be known that they are not always at the shrine. Or, as a finale, this is where they do their dastardly deeds and must be confronted in an epic battle!
The totem should give the witch bonus faith points, a focus of certain rituals, a bonus to casting her magic and more.




Strategic terrain! Could hide ambushers, home of wild boars, part of obstacles along path or as treacherous terrain tests!
